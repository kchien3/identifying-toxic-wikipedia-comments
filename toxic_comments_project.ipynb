      "In general the reusable part of fuel are long lived and the part that complicate reuse of spent fuel are short lived In general fuel becomes easier to reprocess over time largely because le shielding is needed to protect against radiation from the decay of short lived fission product One exception is the decay of Pu with a half life of year to Am half life year Though the decay rate is much lower the radiation hazard is higher because the decay includes a low energy gamma ray Recycled fuel with higher Am is therefore somewhat harder to handle safely Also the Am is not fissile and is therefore prone to absorb neutron in a standard light water reactor and produce higher transuranics rather than fission and produce energy and fission product so the spent fuel is also harder to handle Fast reactor in principle can help reduce these problem since most transuranics undergo fission in a fast neutron spectrum But fast reactor do not have a strong track record of reliability and carry a significant cost premium So in considering the economics of recycling its important to take into account not only the cost premium of the fuel but also the cost premium of the reactor needed to use the recycled fuel most effectively\n"

      "Hi. Could you please stop enforcing the category \"\"Christian arabs\"\" on non arabic Christians living in the middle east? This is wrong. We middle-eastern Christians, though not arabs, have gone through Arabization, and that needs to stop. We are not arabs. We have our own ethnicity, and we shouldn't be forced to be called \"\"Christian arabs\"\". If a Christian European is born in the middle east, should he be called a \"\"Christian arab\"\" because of that reason alone? Please understand, they are Syriac Christians (i.e. of Assyrian ancestry), and most of them speak Aramaic, though a lot of them are forgetting it. As someone who speaks Aramaic, you should respect this fact, and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because they're in the middle east. We are not closely related to the arabs from Saudiarabia. We have our own ethnicity, please stop forcing upon us some alien arab ethnicity. That's oppression. |Talk 12:17 26 Jun, 2007 (UTC)\"\n",

Also, there's some use of a knife/sword in this scene. This is truly one sick film. No, there is no artistic message. This film is basicly a middle finger by the sick-minded film makers.

      "VQuaker.  I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, \"\"someone you know\"\" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can \"\"talk\"\" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.

      "Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )\n",

We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches.

      "Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as \"\"2003–04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City\"\" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.\n",

I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.\n",

In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice.

      "(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history\n",
      "One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern \"\"Slavic\"\" and \"\"Dalmatian\"\" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc\n",

      "{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be \"\"an editor of astrotheology\"\" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more \"\"egregious misintrepretations.\"\" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren't all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don't you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her \"\"vanish\"\" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don't think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid's.

If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity.

Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts?

      "Please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.94.133.166   \n",

      "\n",
      "Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. \"\"The Ten-String Guitar\"\" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact \"\"worthless\"\" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' \"\"short hands\"\" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not \"\"frequently\"\" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as \"\"crutches\"\" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!\n",

This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, \"\"base tan\"\"), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure). \n",

That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as \"\"presenting one side of an argument\"\" to \"\"influence the attitude of the community\"\"? Or, is it that, as you say, I just \"\"don't understand propaganda\"\"? \n",

If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of \"\"good business\"\" - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming o\n",

      "I learned about Adrian’s death after a web search yielded this Wikipedia article (see my post of \"\"In Memoriam\"\" about him to the Freecell Solving Discussions mailing list), and since he was a good Internet friend of mine, and we corresponded extensively on E-mail, I’d like to help with the English Wikipedia article about him. In any case, Ettlinger told me in a private E-mail that he was Jewish (at least by descent - he wasn’t an observant/religious Jew and said something about being a deist), and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category. One problem I see there is that I don't see any sub-category for Jewish American Engineers and/or Jewish American software developers (he was both). I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish (also only by decent) American software developer, and he belongs to the categories \"\"American computer programmers\"\" and \"\"American Jews\"\" and there are naturally many others. I have kept most of the E-mails with him, so can upload them in part to my web-site or elsewhere for citation, nut will it be considered a self-reference? So what should be done?\n",

This is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day, but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process. This means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types, what we need in every single case is the span/rise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semi-circle character.\n",

Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish \"\"state\"\" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.  \"\n",

This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use? How did it compare to other nations' systems?) - once you have adequate treatment of all that, plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate, that's a pretty hefty article, no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of \"\"third-rate\"\". When considering organization like this, it's worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned, and maybe query the editors who set it up, because what you've effectively done is to destroy article structure that I and others carefully set up some time ago. Talk pages are mostly used for debate, so lack of talk page bits combined with multiple editors in history indicates that all the editors agreed perfectly, no need to discuss.  08:01, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)\"\n",
      "\"Italic text\"\"That said, consensus is not simple agreement; a handful of editors agreeing on something does not constitute a consensus, except in the thinnest sense. Consensus is a broader process where specific points of article content are considered in terms of the article as a whole, and in terms of the article's place in the encyclopedia, in the hope that editors will negotiate a reasonable balance between competing views, as well as with the practical necessities of writing an encyclopedia and legal and ethical restrictions.\"\"Italic text\n",

The proposal to restore the old version is also very puzzling in light of the fact that it was a hopeless quagmire, as people repeatedly documented. I categorically reject these proposals by Xandar, but I'm willing to work on including some more material through summary style, which would mean greater coverage of topics that Xandar wants mentioned in the article while also keeping down the length.

      "Hi, Herzen!  Wanted to make sure you saw that I reverted an edit you made on the Pope Francis article, asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. I did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial (not an \"\"article\"\") in the Jerusalem Post. Sorry for my mistake!!! (Guess it was my sloppy thinking, just categorizing \"\"editorials\"\" and \"\"news articles\"\" as different types of \"\"articles\"\".)  However, I think it's a really wonderful quote, only positive. The Jerusalem Post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the Jewish community: those who live in Israel.  If we talk about relations between this pope and the Jewish community, I think it's great to have a quote from a paper like that, basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the Jewish community  perhaps richer than any previous pope. Anyway, I think it's a very good quote in a section that addresses the pope's prior relationship with the Jewish community. I hope you'll reconsider your objection.  In the meantime, I have asked for the opinion of other editors.  Hope we can all agree! Best wishes, and thanks for all your good work on this article.   \"\n",

The MSTGW article speaks against applying labels such as \"\"MSM\"\" and categorizing people.  This would include the MSM label.  That the article specifically refers to these individuals as \"\"MSTGW\"\" and not \"\"MSM\"\" is a good indicator that TG individuals would be non-MSM.  Lastly the HIV-releated Tuberculosis document specifically states that the individuals are male and that: \"\"Some network members dressed as women and participated in dance and fashion competitions known as \"\"balls.\"\" These social networks include \"\"houses\"\" (i.e., a guild providing a social framework for young MSM and transgender persons) that exist in many large U.S. cities (house leader, personal communication, 2000).

      "I appreciate you taking the time to have a look at the edit history. Yes Codf1977 was always very active whilst 'semi-retired, but although they made a couple of edits after their 'retirement' their activity had fallen off almost completely (predictably one of their very few 'retirement' edits was to revert an action that I had made here: []) and on quite a few days there was no activity at all on the account. \n",
      "\n",
      " VHarris44 was clearly not someone completely new to Wikipedia. That much is very clear from their skill in navigating Wikipedia, such as posting a help request on their talk page and posting Advert tags on articles, right from the first day of their activity. This is someone who had prior experience on Wikipedia. It is also I believe reasonably well established that VHarris44's behaviour towards me was inappropriate, they were afterall permanently blocked for their behaviour and four requests by them for a reversal were turned down. There is also the issue of VHarris44 having known details about my university. Did they really find this from looking through the history of my talk page? That has to be extremely unlikely. \n",
      "\n",
      " So the obvious question is, who is VHarris44? A very logical possibility is, another experienced user that I have serious disagreements with. To my knowledge there is only one user in that category. Now in view of the timing of that user's retirement, the fact that that retirement quickly followed their failure to succeed in getting a page that I had created deleted, the fact that one of the only edits during their retirement was to undo one of my edits, and the fact that they then remerged so quickly following my difficulties with VHarris44, this is all very strong circumstantial evidence that VHarris44 and Codf1977 are the same person.  So was Codf1977's detailed exposition of their view of my dealings with VHarris44 here: User talk:TFOWR#Rangoon11's filing of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Codf1977 and his other actions yesterday.\n",

They both seem to have poor spelling. 'such big changes must be agreed in talk page' is an edit description which both Codf1977 and VHarris44 have used. Ultimately there is little text written by VHarris44 to go on though. \n",

That seems very unfair, for even though others may not believe that there is sufficient evidence that Codf1977 and VHarris44 are the same person, I really struggle to see that others cannot see the circumstantial evidence that I saw and therefore relate to why I felt compelled to post a message on the admin board.\n",

      "Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. \"\"The Ten-String Guitar\"\" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]\n",

I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact \"\"worthless\"\" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' \"\"short hands\"\" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not \"\"frequently\"\" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as \"\"crutches\"\" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!\n",

It is an evolving standard defined by what its editors determine to be acceptable, and personally I don't agree with the view that the priority is to write lengthy prose in the style of Encyclopedia Britannica. I've been around since 2007, Jeh has been around since 2005, and Dsimic has been editing a lot since 2013 (in other words, enough to get a very good idea of how Wikipedia's anarchist system works). I'm glad that Jeh prefaced his statement with \"\"in my opinion\"\" because that's what Wikipedia is about, and no personal statement (or even an essay such as commonly-cited arguments to avoid essay) is law. We debate a lot. I know just how much sucks but it's the way it is. Now, whether or not product lists are not-so-good articles is (debatably, if you you're axiologically inclined) an empirical and subjective question which could be most reliably answered by surveying our users, or our editors if they're not your priority. In my experience, lists are great for their purpose, and as a power Wikipedia user and editor, I've derived enormous benefit from them - and our users probably derive much more benefit from an article like Comparison of smartphones than the benefit which is derived from, say, the dozens of references I've added to articles like Tort, Trust law, or Economics and hundreds of much lower traffic niche topics. Lists in general are not easy candidates for \"\"good articles\"\"; as I recall, back around 2008 or so there was a campaign by a couple people to to delete a lot of list articles on that basis and on the duplication with categories, but when I pointed to WP:CSL, the steam was taken out even though that didn't change the sensibility of the decisions.

      "Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable.\n",
      "Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down.\n",
      "The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said \"\"Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,\"\" a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources.\n",
      "All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) \n",
      "Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase \"\"Legend in his own mind\"\". Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages.

      "up, Martinez decided to law low from the city for a while, but eventually came back to mess with Vic’s woman, Louise. Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez’s and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez’s operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz’s mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City’s Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down “South” to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld. Through those progresses, he performed robbery on a bank, produced porn films,\n",

The committee do announce explicitly that a privilege was granted to them. They are not thanking men for this. We have to adopt a scrupulously NPOV in quoting the donor of that privilege. It is a notable item of Jehovah's belief that all the books of the Bible have a single author in contrast to mainstream Christianity that acknowledges a number of authors at different times. But I choose to say \"\"a heavenly Author, not the heavenly Author, to avoid getting into loaded and POV consideration of that Author being unique or not.

I have no argument against that logic. However it may be too near WP:SYN because the Jehovah's Witnesses may not intend or even be aware of that argument's logic. Unless someone provides an source that says explicitly that the NWT is among the uninspired translations, we may not generate our own criticism this way.

My own 1990 dictionary says demographics: data resulting from the science of demography, and demography: the scientific study of human populations, especially with relation to their size, structure and distribution. So on that basis, the articles would be correctly titled 'demographics of...', and quote lots of statistics. It would appear to me that, according to my quite large dictionary, the article is wrong in its definition of these two terms. At the least, it should explain that there is a possible different understanding of the terms.\n",

I suspect that a difference in understanding of the terms has crept in because such people are only interested in a subset of the total information.   \n",

Once human population is no longer an essential part of the study (as in climate, landmass etc. which will be the same regardless of population) it is no demography; I do agree that if climate has an effect on the population (e.g. in the arctic region people tend to protect themselves against cold) it is interesting from demography; but without such reference not.   \n",

      "\n",
      "By Aung Thiha\n",
      "\n",
      "What is transitional justice? Before we talk about some main mechanisms for transitional justice for future Burma, we are supposed to know what transitional justice is. It is mainly subject to the human rights abuses in the past. The most important thing is to search for a justice for both victims and perpetrators involved in the past without any bias. Therefore, we are supposed to find appropriate ways to help those who had seriously suffered from human rights abuses in the past. It is also important to handle those who committed the human rights abuses in the past in appropriate ways. We have to find the truth from both victims and perpetrators without taking sides. It is unquestionable that both opposition groups and military generals have hardliners. For instance, U Kyi Maung, who is one of the members of the National League of Democracy (NLD), used to answer the question made by journalists, saying that they were going to establish international military tribunals like the ones in Germany (8th August 1945) and to try military generals who committed the crimes in the past. It was really a threat for the military generals who are afraid of prosecution. As a result, it can lead to internecine circumstances. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to the transitional justice in Burma, we consider some main mechanisms to create justice in transitional period. First, in advance we have to investigate the details as to the violations of human rights committed by the military regime in the past so as to become aware of when, where and how they happen. The investigation can include individuals or institutions involved in the past human rights abuses. There can be a lot of obstacles or delay in investigating the abuses. We can also get tangible information from the government files, mass graves and testimonies. For instance, we can investigate the abuses by uncovering the mass graves carried out by the Burmese army in the jungle and by identifying the bodies; who they were, how and when they were executed. It will be very helpful for us to do something against the perpetrators during the transitional period. We also have to make sure that we share information collected with the public so that they can help follow the cases. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, regarding to the prosecution we are still undecided whether we are supposed to offer an amnesty to the military generals, or we ought to try them at the international military tribunal like in Germany. Actually, what the military generals fear most is a prosecution. If we prosecute them, the circle of retaliation against each other will not be able to end, but will also delay of transferring political power to the opposition parties or the obstruction of Burma’s political progress. As a consequence, the civilians will be victims again. Furthermore, prosecution against the military generals is irrelevant to the current political situation in Burma. It is not realistic. On the other hand, if we forgive the generals for their abuses and offer an amnesty to them with a view to the development of the country as a whole, it seems to ignore or overlook the people who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. They will not be satisfied with us in power, and we will lack credibility. In some cases, we find it difficult to prosecute the perpetrators because they, at the same time, are both perpetrators and victims (e.g child soldiers who are forcibly recruited by the SPDC). It is not always possible to regard them as criminals. Therefore, both sides are supposed to think about the whole circumstance and try to negotiate the issues for the sake of the whole country and its people rather than focusing on obtaining political power or personal feelings. It is also important to try to reduce grievances being rooted in both sides. Prosecuting the military generals is not a good solution for the group in power in the long term.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, in the transitional period we can also use civil sanction against those who were involved in the human rights abuses in the past. As I already mentioned, by letting people look at the files that include the details of past human rights abuses, they can distinguish the victims and perpetrators. Then, they can prevent anyone who they think were supporters or collaborators in the past human rights abuses from being involved in future political role by means of demonstration. By not allowing the supporters or collaborators involved in the past human rights abuses to be involved in future politics, we also have to show that we respect the dignity of the people and do not overlook or ignore their sufferings from the past. \n",

Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again.

These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings.  I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front.  I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks.  I think i've had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links.  It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I've seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings.  Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial.  You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I've been making.

But really look over the puzzles and the analysis. It really is a work of art. If you care about chess you would do it. But I think you care more about not being wrong. You insert POV that it is refuted. This is a lie. A very very obvious lie. I would post this on their talk but I seriously dont care. I care about the beauty of chess and of my own work. If I wanted to be a GM I would have been but its not an ego thrill for me. All I care about is the beauty of the game and I believe my puzzles express just that.\n",

      "\n",
      "1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.\n",
      "\n",
      "3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by \"\"kind ol' Uncle Joe\"\" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a \"\"dictator\"\" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.\n",

      "As I've already written above, I oppose placing Gibson's bio in the 'Anti-Semitic People' category because he vigorously denies the charge and listing him as such, without qualification, is tantamount to calling him a liar.  Anti-Semitism is a very serious and potentially libelous charge, and Wikipedia should categorically label a person as anti-Semitic only in cases where the person either admits to being anti-Semitic or admits to holding unquestionably anti-Semitic views.  Gibson has done neither and in fact vigorously denies both charges.  I do, however, sympathize with people who continue to add the 'anti-Semitic People' tag to his page. I therefore propose the creation of a new category called 'People accused of anti-Semitism'. The category would be for people who face (or have faced) substantiated charges of anti-Semitism from respected sources.  \"\"Substantiated charges\"\" would obviously mean that there was reliable evidence to support the charge (as opposed to a \"\"my best friend's roommate told me\"\" accusation), and \"\"respected sources\"\" would refer primarily to credible individuals and organizations that have an accomplished track record of identifying and combating anti-Semitism (civil rights organizations like ADL and SPLC come to mind).  This new category would allow Wikipedia to associate the anti-Semitism controversy with Gibson's article without actually leveling the charge that he is anti-Semitic.  Thoughts?  \n",

      "I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n",

The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis.

In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.\n",

      "Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable.

Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black.

I always try to check before I create a new article that it hasn't been done before, but googling the site first (and also double-checking in the categories) seems to be the best way to do it. The good news is you could easily merge your list into the pre-existing ones and raise their quality. By keeping the lists focused on one topic, it would also be possible to illustrate every single insignia (so long as there is a photo on Wikipedia or Commons somewhere). Like I said, the list you produced was fundamentally of \"\"featurable\"\" quality (possibly with a little bit of work, but not much) and there are plenty of lists on Wikipedia that are of very low quality yet are inherently featurable if they got a little bit of TLC.

This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them.

Now, whoever originated this thing did the disinformation. Unsuspecting folks forwarded misinformation. Again, the one who started the FB chain was doing disinformation (albeit more mischief than not, perhaps). But, I saw many reasonable folks take it at face value. There may be several reasons for this: trust of the sender, spider phobia, not taking the time to check out the message before forwarding (Share or Comment in the FB milieu). It was nice to find the Wikipedia page's section on the Hoax. Ought we have a category for hoaxes (motivated by continuing examples which necessitate discussion of this topic)? My little example is probably one of many that were active today where some of these might have been downright malevolent. BTW, this is the status of the page when I last edited (2007).

I pointed out to user Dinesh Kannambadi about one portion of text mentioned in the article on the Western Chalukyas. The said portion is copied in here for your information and consideration as an admin:\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.[44] This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.[45]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the above passage, while it may be ok for giving info on kingdoms in western deccan or deccan whose mutual antagonisms filled history annals.... I feel that mentioning the demise of the Cholas (who did so in 1279/1285 AD) in the Chalukya page who got eclipsed in 1190 WHICH IS ALMOST 90 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT OF THE CHALUKYAS, is quite inappropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr.Kannambadi also mentions that the Chalukyas convincingly eclipsed the Cholas after the Cholas lost Vengi is quite untrue. This is because Vengi was lost by the Chalukyas to the Cholas themselves under Vikrama Chola for after winning Vengi in 1119 or 1118, Vikramaditya expired in 1125 or so and was followed by very weak successors and the Chalukya capital itself was lost for around 30 years from 1136-1140 (courtesy, Ancient India by K.A.N.Sastri, 1956 edition). So what does he mean there, by winning Vengi and keeping it for 6-8 years the Cholas were convincingly eclipsed by the Chalukyas... Does it mean that we are to believe that sustaining a victory for 6-8 years enables an empire to claim glory or feeling that their opponents were convincingly eclipsed.  I know Kannambadi will also speak about jingoism and that Hoysalas too won Gangavadi from Cholas, but pls. remind him that the same was prior to the Chalukyas conquering Vengi.  I am sure you will be very well acquainted with these facts in case you have in-depth knoweldge of Indian History especially that of South India.\n",

The \"\"Allegiance\"\" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. \n",

That does not mean that fiction plays a comparably important role in the philosophy of language nor in physics.

I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn't a pilot episode of TAGS).  \n",

      "Wikipedia has started to hit the big time.

      "Let me preface this by saying that I know Wikipedia is very cool. A lot of people do not think so, but of course they are wrong. So the following must be taken in the spirit of someone who knows and supports the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "First problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.\n",
      "\n",
      "My point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers. A great many of my colleagues are not at all impressed with the project; but more about that in a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another benefit accruing from robust public credibility is even more widespread use and support by teachers, schools, libraries, and the general publicprecisely the people who want to use what they believe to be a credible encyclopedia. To the extent that the project is not reaching, and being supported by, these people, it is not succeeding as well as it might.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps you might also maintain that, while Wikipedia does not now have a reputation for reliability, it will eventually, once enough studies proving its reliability are done, and once people are more familiar with the concept behind the project. This is hard to argue with; but it is also hard to support, because it involves predicting the future, and the future, when it comes to public opinion, is extremely unpredictable. It would be better to do something to help guarantee a reputation for reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wikipedia has another sort of credibility problem, mentioned in passing above, and I fear that time is not a solution to this problem, the way it might be to the foregoing one. Namely, one can make a good case that, when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven. If the project was lucky enough to have a writer or two well-informed about some specialized subject, and if their work was not degraded in quality by the majority of people, whose knowledge of the subject is based on paragraphs in books and mere mentions in college class\n",

      "I don't think we ever resolved one big problem with the article: Rand is not a philosopher. The article continues to push the POV suggestion that she is indeed a philosopher, which is an opinion only supported by her and her followers. There is only one professor in all of academia that supports the idea that she is a philosopher, and thus the article is pushing an extreme minority view as the truth. We are essentially doing the complete opposite of what we are supposed to do with psuedoscience articles in an article about psuedophilosophy. The NPOV warning will remain on this article until we truly resolve this dispute.  LGagnon \n",
      "\n",

      "Remove all POV claims that she is a philosopher; replace them with something along the lines of \"\"Rand claimed to be a philosopher.\"\"\n",

      "Remove categories that refer to her as a philosopher.  LGagnon \n",

      "Response to Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "There are too many conceptual difficulties with LGagnon's suggestions. Again, we need good grounding, not unsourced opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin. The distinction between philosophy proper and pseudo-philosophy requires a fleshing out of criteria. Don't conflate Anglo-American analytic philosophy with the ubiquitous  belief-system development that preceded it. Or you can scrub virtually all Continental systems (endless varieties of Existentialism(s))from the category (of philosophy).\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the analytic of North America is merely a method for doing philosophy. It eschews systems as such, due to the influence of empiricist/positivist skepticism going all the way back to David Hume. (Recall Hume awakened Kant  at least so Kant relayed  from \"\"dogmatic slumber.\"\" Philosophy has not been the same since.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, though we speak of belief-systems, since the decline of the Middle ages, and the notorious rote of the Trivium/Quadrivium, these systems have been increasingly secular and secularized in knowledge and value emphases. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that respect, Objectivism is no less than its equally original, equally American conceptual cousin: pragmatism. Indeed, LGagnon's very student-musings about the exact status of Objectivism in this regard remind one of the reception pragmatism suffered (and suffers still) by comparison to earlier Theocentric philosophic systems. William James famously claimed that the very first real lecture on philosophy that he ever attended was the one he himself taught.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ergo, \"\"ideology\"\" would not be a neutral mode of reference with regard to Objectivism anyway. That loads the controversial \"\"Objectivism-as-cult\"\" smack into the supposedly neutral explication of the system. It utterly distorts the sourcing and external material that is required by Wikipedia. It loads original opinion/research of the most expansive sort. It fails to unpack the place of reason in the Randian corpus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh incidentally, many, very many philosophers in the analytic school disdain the Continentalists as philosophers. They used to refer to them, when favourably disposed, as philosophes  a la that great Continental Trio of the Enlightenment, Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu). Othertimes, analytics would dismiss your average Continentalist as a \"\"philosoher-manque.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ayn Rand did not consider herself primarily a novelist. She explicitly addressed the issue of the novelist-philosopher distinction and with characteristic disdain: sneering at what she perceived to be the implication that one ruled the other out.

      "I would like to strongly advise against deletion of this article on the argument that phylogenetics is not equal to, nor even synonymous to, cladistics. The difference between them is actually abyssal. Phylogenetics is a scientific discipline resting on the fundamental principle of objectivity, whereas cladistics instead is the opposite, resting on the principle of subjectivity. Phylogenetics partitions reality into categories (i.e. concepts) and discusses reality in terms of these categories, whereas cladistics instead assumes that categories (concepts) exist and confuses them. What phylogenetics discerns does cladistics confuse. In line with this approach, cladistics also strives hard to confuse itself (as a concept) with (the concept) phylogenetics and with (the concept) science. My empirical support for these allegations is that cladistics confuses time and space, thereby denying that time can be relative to space, which is contradicted by the fact that time is relative to space (see Envall, Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 94:217-220). Cladistics \"\"denies\"\" the kind of thing it calls paraphyletic groups, which actually is a disguised denial of the fundament for science, that is, objectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deletion of this article would thus be devastating for phylogenetics, and in continuation, for encyclopedias (which tries to keep concepts apart) and maybe also for science itself. Instead, the article ought to be cleaned from cladistic influence. There is still a big part of phylogenetics that is (practically) free from cladistic influence, i.e., that which develops probability inferences of phylogeny, and still does the consistent conceptualization of phylogenies, that is, the Linnean system, occupy a central position in phylogenetics. \n",
      "\n",
      "A clensing of the article does, however, appear impossible in an open forum like this, since nothing can hinder cladists from incorporating their confusion in the article, whereas they can hinder a resolution of the confusion. The power over the content in articles is in practice related to number of proponents of certain comprehensions, rather than to knowledge about them or understanding of them. One can easily envision how Wikipedia would have appeared if it had been made of Germans during the 2:nd World War. Nazism would certainly not have been described in condescending terms. This is a fundamental problem for Wikipedia that needs to be addressed for Wikipedia to retain reliability. A basic requirement ought to be that its editors have at least some (scientific) education. There has to be some Captain(s) on the ship, and they have to have some (scientific) education. Otherwise, Wikipedia will gradually disintegrate into a mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Wikipedia finds no other phylogeneticist that can (and wants to) clean up the article, I am prepared to do it. It does, however, require that I am given the power to include and exclude contributions to the best of my judgement and knowledge. My neutrality has been questioned in connection with my earlier contributions to Wikipedia, but as I have tried to explain, I consider a scientific approach (i.e., objectivity) to be neutral. The problem with cladistics is that it is subjective and \"\"denies\"\" objectivity, since it leaves no neutral position between it and objectivity. There is no neutral position between a denial of a comprehension and that comprehension. I instead counter the \"\"denial\"\" by falsifying it with empirical evidence. This does not \"\"counter-deny\"\" cladistics, but only shows that cladistics does not agree with facts, whereas objectivity (i.e., science) does. I thus show that cladistics' \"\"denial\"\" of science does not agree with facts. This conclusion is not neutral, but it is as neutral (or objective) as anything possibly can be. Questioning of this view on neutrality has to require an explanation of what else neutrality possibly can be. For me, neutrality is equal to objectivity. (Some claim that objectivity is impossible, but I claim that it is not. This is, however, another story).\n",

      "Since English language obviously doesn't have its own name for this woman (Mary Leszczyńska?), Anglophone historians have to choose between Polish spelling - Maria Leszczyńska - and French spelling - Marie Leczinska. French language was, and still is, naturally closer to English than Polish, which is probably why most Anglophone historians choose Marie Leczinska. A quick Google Book Search confirms this: Maria Leszczyńska gets 96 \"\"English-language\"\" results (though all I've seen are Polish books), while Marie Leczinska gets 808 English-langauge results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides being closer to an Anglophone (for whom the article is written), the proposed title has another benefit: the lack of diacritics. \"\"Diacritics, especially Polish diacritics, make articles much more difficult to link to (it takes me about a minute to track down the proper letter and then copy/paste it), they interfere with proper alphabetization in category listings, are visually very intimidating to many English-speakers, cause confusion for pronounciation, and do not always display correctly on all web browsers.\"\"\n",

      "Another posibility is Marie Leszczyńska; it is significantly more popular than Maria Leszczyńska (c. 400 hits), but Marie Leczinska is twice as popular as Marie Leszczyńska. Moreover, Marie Leszczyńska lacks the aforesaid benefit: it contains diacritics.\n",

      " Thanks for the compliment! It's true, content is my main passion. I am happiest when doing lots of content creation/editing and community building, and I believe I do my best work when happy, and am least likely to get testy or make rash decisions. I tend to go through cycles in my editing. Recently, there's been a great deal of content creation that interests me, so that's what I've been most focused on. (A major recent exception would be the discussion of image placeholders, which has involved doing a lot of work to try to determine consensus from a broad segment of the WP community.) When I get less inspired on content, I tend to go on Recent changes patrol, jump into an XfD or RfA debate, etc. In my opinion, it is a good thing to have administrators who are heavily focused on content, and make brief forays into administrative duties. I recognize that some hold differing views; to them I would say, it's essential that an administrator have sufficient experience with things like image licensing and fair use, other projects like Commons and Wikinews, deletion debates, mediation, etc. to act accordingly. I certainly feel that I have enough experience with that stuff. I have nominated numerous articles for deletion, using speedy, PROD and AfD procedures; I don't know a good way to assess the results, but my sense is that the most of my recommendations have been approved. I do lots of vandalism reversion, and would estimate that I include subst'ed  templates about 80% of the time. I have recommended the occasional block for stuff like 3RR. I participate in CfD's and IfD's. I'm familiar with lots of criteria (like speedy delete); I would not claim to know any by rote, but my familiarity makes it possible to read up on something and act pretty quickly.\n",

      "The first question you need to ask yourself is, \"\"do I have a history (perhaps as yet unadmitted) of being overly critical of myself?\"\" If the answer to this might be yes, then you can't always trust your own tendency to self-criticize, because your subconscious motivation is not self-improvement but self-denigration; don't pay that too much heed then. If, however, the answer is no, then if you notice a behavior of yours that bothers you, listen to the notice, and decide cognitively how much it really bothers you or should bother you. Sometimes we only notice what bugs us about ourselves by trying to observe ourselves objectively. You might be doing that, and you might do well to listen, but it's hard for me to weigh this. As for my own opinion, looking at Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 11#Abortion, you haven't added anything that was redundant, so I wouldn't say it's an issue. If the discussion gets long and people keep bringing up things that you've already answered, remember that the closing admin is going to read everything and they should notice if you've already answered a repeated objection. Then it's a question of how much faith you have in the admins (I know, I'm treading on very thin ice now). For instance, I made sure to answer everything at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International because I wanted to be absolutely certain that if the article did get deleted, I couldn't blame myself for not trying everything. I'm likely to do the same thing at Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 5#Ali Sina if anyone opposes the citations I've dug up. But my motivation here is dedication to freedom of speech and for less critical articles I leave my comments for the admin and let it go. A rule of thumb that you should know is that if an article is up for deletion and 80% of the votes are keep, it will probably be kept (even though it's \"\"not a vote\"\"). If it's less than 80%, then the keepers will have to put forward a pretty solid argument to keep. As you can see at the Faith Freedom AfD, keepers had about 66% and we just barely came through with \"\"no consensus\"\". I suspect that the factors that weighed most heavily for the admin were TruthSpreader's and my arguements, as almost no one else seriously argued the merits of the citations and notability guidelines.\n",

      "I just found that I am unblocked now. This block reminded me of Hkelkar,Bakasuperman combination who used to get me blocked very often in very similar fashion. The longest block so far. Perhaps, longer ones are in the way! People have already threatened it on my talk page. Well, If I get challenged I feel more determination. One shocking fact I recently learnt is WP:ANI is up again. We had got it deleted earlier. It was WP:AN/I if I remember correctly. I had proposed, it has the potential of becoming another Fundywatchlist, which many others accepted and it got deleted. For those who are unaware of what Fundywatchlist was, I would like to elaborate, it was a page on wikipedia itself to discuss the ways to harass some users and POVise the pages in the name of cleaning and improvement. Members included were some Indian Admins, and a bunch of like minded users, who used to discuss whom to target and how to achieve their ends. It got deleted, and slowly the admins involved were shown the way out. However, these people started getting smarter, and found user:Yellowmonkey alias blnguyen, an American Vietnamese, as their mask. This guy was very popular among Indian circle and was acknowledged as good troubleshooter, though I always smelled something different. Hkelkar was in his good books, and once in a rv war on Kancha Ilaiah, article, where hkelkar was hell bent on writing a libellous term in lead, he went to the extent of not only protecting the page rv in his favor, but also shamelessly declared, \"\"I have protected the page for you\"\". After that Ben W Bells Dispute Resolution started, who neglected my request to remove the term first, saying he cannot unprotect the page protected by a different admin. Majority ruling made Hkelkar, the winner. No, actually He didn't win, I left the page forever, because everybody was against me there. Blnguyen wrote a note there, just below my unprotect request, \"\"I didn't know it has stuck\"\" However, what happened afterwards, is more interesting. I requested, checkuser on Hkelkar and tagged him as sockpuppeteer. Blnguyen, ritualistically, blocked me for bogus tagging - you can check my block log. and, lo, both checkuser and arbcom decision was in my favor. Since then blnguyen has never been shameless enough to look into my eyes. I could have raised finger on him during arbcom, though I dropped this idea later on, because one thing was evident Blnguyen was not a bad person, he was into bad company. Going through the talks above, I get the same feeling about many non-indian users here. \n",

From where this idea come s I would like to be educated. I find it rather funny, because you are saying they are claiming what they actually are and that too from central asia!!!

You cannot adopt a convention which is not in sync with real life usage.

If you want to differentiate, present day Yadvas from ancient ones, better tag it as scriptural or mythical. \n",

The document was published as an NBER working paper which means that it may have undergone some sort of review process but it was not published in a peer-reviewed journal or other venue where we are assured of editorial oversight and quality control (although I assume that the NBER has those kinds of mechanisms in place; I just don't know for sure).

      "Thomas Jefferson is credited with initiating the science of vertebrate paleontology in the United States with the reading of a paper to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1797. Jefferson presented fossil bones of a ground sloth found in a cave in western Virginia and named the genus (Megalonyx). The species was ultimately named Megalonyx jeffersonii in his honor.Jefferson, Thomas, \"\"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia\"\", Read before the American Philosophical Society, March 10, 1797. The \"\"certain bones\"\" consisted of three large claws and associated smaller bones. He theorized that they were the remains of an extinct lion which he named Megalonyx (\"\"giant claw\"\"). In 1799, Dr. Caspar Wistar correctly identified the remains as belonging to a giant ground sloth. In 1822 Wistar officially named it Megalonyx jeffersonii.Jefferson, Thomas (1799), \"\"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia\"\", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 4 pp. 246-260.Wistar, Caspar (1799), \"\"A Description of the Bones Deposited, by the President, in the Museum of the Society, and Represented in the Annexed Plates\"\", Transactions, pp. 526-531, plates. Jefferson corresponded with Cuvier, including sending him a shipment of highly desirable bones of the American mastodon and the woolly mammoth.Rice, Howard C, Jr., \"\"Jefferson's Gift of Fossils to the Museum of Natural History in Paris,\"\" Proceeding of the American Philosophical Society, 95 (1958): 597-627.\n",

Another thing is notability, which basically means that you can create an acronym about something, but that does not make it automatically notable. Without citations to reliable, third-party sources (such as news articles, professional journal articles, magazine articles, etc.,), then articles are likely to be deleted. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and, additionally, I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline, because your username is the same as the title of the article. The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves, their company, organization, product, or family or friends, as they would likely be unable to edit neutrally. Neutrality is another of Wikipedia's core policies. I'd encourage you to review the policies and guidelines given here, and once you have, consider if indeed, the article you submitted was verifiable by multiple reliable sources, and displayed notability.

The Republic of Central Lithuania was neither formed because of the revolution nor during it. I kindly ask you to explain the connection between the Russian revolution and Central Lithuania before you put back the category. I know that the communist propaganda portrayed the independence of much of Central and Eastern Europe as a consequence of one of Lenin's speeches in which he gave those states (he did not have influence on whatsoever) a right to secede, though this doesn't hold the water at all. \n",

If Pele calls himself Pele all over the world in Spanish, German, Italian etc but wants to give himself the name “Frogman” in English – it doesn’t mean that everyone has to agree with him or call him this.

      "Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering's attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man's lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his \"\"mouth\"\", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this? I have not taken part in any edit war, on the contrary, I have asked help and I have explain\n",

      "Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as \"\"integral thinkers\"\", doing work that is called \"\"Integral Studies\"\", can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or \"\"Integral (AQAL)\"\" and \"\"Integral\"\", as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:\n",
      "...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has \"\"mutually influenced\"\" Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called \"\"Integral theory (Wilberian)\"\" or \"\"Integral theory\"\" (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? \n",
      "I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as \"\"anti-Soviet elements\"\" among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (\"\"Yezhov storm\"\").

Thus, for example, there is no stub type for Turkish North Cyprus, since it is only recognised by one country.

      "Hi , I like your opinion piece draft!  It's great in providing many quantifications of the promo/commercial articles.  I like how you narrate your WikiProject Poland experience and develop from that.  I like how you call for a major cleanup drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end, though, you ask the readers to go off separately and do a little bit towards solving the problem.  IMO that is not enough, and you've motivated something bigger, a big cleanup drive, but that should be a lot more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe you should compare your proposal to the big drive to address Un-Referenced Biographies of Living People (URBLP)s, a problem that was recognized more and more during 2009, and then blew up in controversy in January 2010, I think it was.  There was one editor deleting them by the hundreds, I think, which made others mad.  And Wikipedia was hammered in the outside news coverage about some salient bad incidents.  The problem was addressed by a big drive, with one element being wp:URBLP Wikiproject's efforts that I happened to join.  The drive was well-focused because there was a known number, 52,000, of unreferenced BLPs in a category, to be addressed, (although there were new ones coming in, and more old ones being discovered of course).  And that one editor agreed to back off, IF the number was reduced by half in six months.  That's my very imperfect understanding of the situation before I joined.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The drive I participated in worked well.  I tried to help keep focus on the goal, and in several other ways, but some others had far more direct impact than I did.  See Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Unreferenced Biographies of Living Persons/Archive 2#Goal statement.  Every day we could see the current number, and it moving or not, and some big changes were made to reduce the number of new URBLPs coming in, and some other targeted efforts were tried and some clearly made a difference while others did not.  Overall, having the big, numeric public goal that we wanted to meet, and having immediate feedback/gratification in seeing the total category's number change, was key.  It was rewarding and frustrating and a team effort going on, etc., not just a bunch of people working completely separately.  In the end the 6 month goal was finally met though it was very close.  Then I and some others dropped out but the overall problem had been somewhat \"\"solved\"\", and it's been better since, and the number was brought all the way down to 0 effectively, and is at about 2,000 now, I see. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not saying you should talk much or at all about that URBLP problem and its drive, in your opinion piece. But I think your calling for accurate measurement of the current problem, by a one-month effort to get all of the problematic articles tagged, say, the same way, would be reasonable.  There would have to be an enforceable rule made up, that prevented the paid PR persons from deleting the tags on their articles.  There was something like that with the URBLPs...I think anyone seen deleting the URBLP tag was warned and blocked as disruptive if necessary.  And then you can call for something aggressive:  like bringing the \"\"real\"\" number down to 100,000 tops within a year, or whatever.  Your estimating the problem size to be 150,000 is helpful towards setting that up.  Or you could call for something quite different.  My main reaction, anyhow, was that I expected at the end for you to call for something big.  Asking people to separately make efforts that would not even be measurable, would not be enough, IMO.  You've earned the right to call for a bigger more organized effort.\n",

      "Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~\"\n",

      "Lloyd was born in Burchard, Nebraska, to James Darsie Lloyd (1865–1947) and Elizabeth Fraser (1869–1941); Harold's paternal great-grandparents were all from Wales. Young Harold was named for his paternal grandfather. Harold had an older brother, Gaylord (1888-1943), five years his senior. Like his younger brother, Gaylord acted in motion pictures, but his career was nowhere near as renowned as Harold's. Among other roles, he acted in 1921's \"\"Disraeli\"\" starring the famous George Arliss.  With Harold's help, there were even efforts to turn him into a comedy star.  He eventually went on to become a film executive.  When Harold was a child, his parents divorced and Lloyd chose to stay with his father.  Despite this, he and his brother always remained close to their mother.  Harold's father was always dreaming up grand get-rich-quick schemes that ended in disasters. They eventually ended up in Omaha where Lloyd had his first acting experience in a local stock company. He attended East High School and San Diego High School and received his stage training at the School of Dramatic Art (San Diego). In 1912, his father J. Darsie \"\"Foxy\"\" Lloyd was awarded the then-massive sum of $6,000 in a personal injury judgment (although this was split evenly between Lloyd and his lawyer) after being run over by an Omaha beer truck. Reportedly, on the toss of a coin (\"\"Heads is New York or Nashville or where I decide!, tails is San Diego\"\"), he and Lloyd moved west.\n",

      "Lloyd had acted in various Vaudeville acts in theaters since boyhood, and started acting in one-reel film comedies shortly after moving to California. He soon began working with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, and eventually formed a partnership with fellow struggling actor and director Hal Roach, who had formed his own studio in 1913. The hard-working Lloyd became the most successful of Roach's comic actors between 1915 and 1919.\n",

But Bayside is now established, having had its own identity since the löate 1960's, and being essentially an \"\"island\"\" between DART and coast road.  The only issue which blurs the lines is the occasional attempt to \"\"rebrand\"\" parts of it as Sutton.  So I have created the Bayside category, which has a respectable number of entries anyway.  Perhaps later we should reconsider Sutton Park, Hazelbury Green  and many road / street articles, but until we can review the topic as a whole, I think we can leave them, as long as no one attempts to list them directly as suburbs - they must fit into a larger topic which is properly notable.   \"\n",

      " In my opinion, the three lists you just mentioned need improvement to reach the standards of the Oregon and Washington lists (that is completely independent of the fact that I promoted those two lists to FL statusthey simply contain more facts, stronger leads, more references, etc).  I think that a single table is more appropriate as it can be sorted and the order of sections seem somewhat arbitrary by making some symbols more important than others. Also, I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols. I have no problem with having a table for the \"\"Unofficial symbols\"\" sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables. I know nothing about Governors lists, but I believe some have been promoted to FL status so it is probably worth examining those. Hopefully I will get around to improving the Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana symbols lists. In the meantime (just to make the FLC nomination process easier and for the sake of consistency) I would mimic the Oregon and Washington symbols lists since they have been promoted much more recently than the other three.

Categorization based on religion and sexual orientation are, quite rightly, singled out with additional criteria that do not apply to information in the text of an article. I think there is a serious question that remains as to whether membership in a house of worship, by itself, satisfies the \"\"public self-identification\"\" requirement of the rule. This issue will very likely come up in other biographies of people from a variety of faiths. Categories, especially regarding religion and sexual orientation, are more than simple navigational tools, but can give undue weight to specific elements of a person's background. I directed these comments to you since, as an administrator, you might be more concerned about the implications of these things than the average editor.

      "\n",
      "The Working it out Tour started in 2010 with Traci K Shoop taking it to the next level of fitness.  By adding music with muscle and modeling.  She presented herself through the east coast and some west promoting health and music.  Presented in part for association FPLA to raise money  helping with her in transition and team artists and athletes become members to showcase to be promoted.  Traci's music was a hit on her teaser song Kiss me love me...with holiday added starting in December featuring her very first christmas album \"\" Tis the Season to be Sexy\"\".  This album earned her credentials for a peoples choice nomination where voted amongst some of the top pop artists like Susan Doyle and Mariah Carey.  In this tour she went around presenting a way to help with hard times by giving back to support her coming back out from supporting the troops.  It landed her even top awards with Karaoke social networks. When making the top charts in with her \"\" Be My Santa BAby\"\" it inspired her to bring out for the tour for kisses with the United States Entertainment organization with the service members.  With allowing her to get a chance to mission to meet and greet soldiers during the war time to give morale and become a long distance pen pal.  She herself committed 14 years as a spouse and served under contract training soldiers and families during the times when most effected by stress and abandonment.  Traci's goal as an artist and pro athlete was to bring as many people on the team to help with promoting them during transitional times asking other non service artists who were working to try and contribute financially or through contributions.  But to also honor the ones who like her served not under combat but through missions and it earned her loyality pin, coins and awards with national congressional committes. Where she placed on the board. The true inspiration to push to try and break from the low income of serving and being honored and recognized truly with demanding to be heard.  This tour was of course a struggle with many of the financial reasons and not allowing to spread the truth of what really goes on and how it effects families.  The way some are not truly appreciated on both ends when helping while others in the entertainment receive huge amounts of money and media exposure with little to ever be left for the ones who also work for their freedom.  To also showcase true health and fitness through the arts and science of things.  Which actually helped land her first emmy nomination in two categories in 2010.  \n",

      "\"==Passion Killing in Namibia==\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Cambridge Advance Learner’s Dictionary, passion is defined as a very powerful feeling, for example of sexual attraction, love, hate, anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder. In this context Passion Killing is combined.Passion Killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger, love, hate or other emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past passion killing in Namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend. Recently, a large number of continuous Passion killing cases have been reported. So far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women, breakups and infidelities being 2 of the main reasons amongst many.In this article I’m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society, who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The causes\n",
      "The question on everyone’s lips is, “why are men killing women?”\n",
      "\n",
      " Amongst many causes, the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support, for things such as accommodation, tuition fees in a case of a student, food, clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case, men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits, the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women.The Namibian, 2012Namibian\n",
      "\n",
      " Another major cause that leads to Passion killing in our society is infidelity from women. When a woman cheats and the men finds out, the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing.\n",
      "\n",
      " A possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women.Causes\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is at fault?\n",
      "As I have observed, both men and women are to be blamed in different cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, certain men are at fault are because they don’t seem to understand the real meaning of love. \"\"The country should cry out for help. True love is patient, love is kind - it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.. Bishop Kleopas Dumeni, 2012 \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if love is not involved, as it is in some cases, one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property.In other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it, In the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost. But little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons, be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface, then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties. \n",
      "Either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "Recommendations \n",
      "The solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this Nation. Knowing the diversity of people, it’s hard to figure out what would impact certain people.  Never –the –less, the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on. Informante\n",
      "A number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty. But I believe one cannot fix another evil with evil.\"\"So what is the exact answer to the problem, should we bring back the death penalty? Will it stop the passion killings?\n",

As I said, if this is a reliable source it is certainly worthy of inclusion, but there are limits to how far we can talk over the actual participants in the faith.  Let's be frank: if Messianic Jews called themselves Christians then there would be no problem, but if they don't then we are essentially engaging in a form of prejudice if we force the term on them.  If you were Catholic, would you like some Protestant insisting that you're not a Christian?  If you're protestant, would you like some Catholic asserting that you are a heretic?  These are not people who are trying to give up their Jewish heritage and become Christians (which would be tremendously easy to do, simply by converting); these are people who want to accept Christ while reaffirming their Jewishness.

      "There are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)\n",
      "Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)  Anyhow, maybe I'm crazy for noticing stuff like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n",

This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals.

He was defined as Jewish by the Nazi Party, because they made the innovation of treating Jews as a race, not a religious community.

      "The separation of Michael's personal life info from the main 'eras' section is going too far with this categorization thing which seems to have swept up the article recently. Introducing an 'influence' section was alright, as that didn't take from the main body, the chronological section, of the article. But taking out things deemed 'personal' and plonking them neatly under four different areas just doesn't flow well. It junts the reader in and out of various years, and just doesn't work. Before, the article was chronological, and a certain degree of chronology is good in a biographical article. Let me clear up one thing: the eras don't just mean what was related to the ALBUM of the era. The eras are simply a convenient way of splitting up Michael's life into nice sections. We don't need to FURTHER split the article up. I think that we should put personal stuff back into the main chronological bit, as people seem to have misinterpreted what the 'eras' are meant to be. His career and his personal life should go together. For example, the Oprah Interview, once aired, significantly increased sales of Dangerous. That link cannot be neatly established if the two 'bits' (for lack of a better word) are separated. I am trying to reach a new consensus to have the personal stuff put back into the main body, as right not the article seems to be a skeleton of subheadings. The eras are tiny, and any reader will be confused by the layout, which isn't chronological. So that's why I'm trying to reach a new consensus: To put the personal life information back into the chronological part of the article.\n",

I'm not planning to wade into this until the situation has died down, but I'm curious what you and other WikiProject Oregon folks think about even having a Southeastern Oregon article.

As the press of 1989 couldn't find a category to neatly file TRT under they chose the recently created funk metal and FNM just shrugged their shoulders. At the time of release FNM were indifferent to the phrase, like any artist they didn't want their work to be pigeonholed but it didn't seem to irk them until the end of 1990 when the term was fired at them in almost every interview. FNM began to loathe this sign that had been hung around their necks and their reaction was to do everything in their creative power to write a forth album that would shove funk metal up the media's rear end!\"\"\n",

I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured.

Namely, if God really is omnipotent, then God can deify mortal man...and if God really is also omnibenevolent, then not only can God deify man, but God's goodness compels God to deify man.  23:36, Nov 4, 2003 (UTC)\n",

Should \"\"omnipotence\"\" and \"\"omnibenevolence\"\" imply, as your argument holds, that making gods out of created beings is something that God must do, then why do you not expect that every person would be exalted?  For that matter, is God too small to exalt animals? vegetables? rocks or sand?\n",

God's divine nature is unfathomable, and will never be understood by us, much less become completely ours. Theosis is rather our participation in God's divine energies (as described/defined by Gregory Palamas) and union with His nature. We will still never be divine in quite the same way that God is divine; we will still always possess a human nature only, it's just that that human nature will be thoroughly healed and cleansed, and united with the divine nature.

First: just because some Bulgarian editors may be misinterpreting or abusing the category system, why should we? Second: what if every article were subjected to your line of thinking? For instance, what if someone decided that Category:Communes in Cluj County was too inaccessible a place for Apahida, and decided to add in Category:Geography of Romania, and then someone did the same for Iclod, and pretty soon, that category ended up with ~3000 entries? Well, for one, it would become pretty useless, don't you think?

You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you.

Up to that point, djembe and dunun were confined to the traditional Malinke area (Mali, Guinea, and parts of Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ivory Coast).)

      "With so much information online, there is a big need for encyclopedias. Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Wikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the \"\"ancient Roman salute\"\" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.\n",

      "The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute.

      "Francis Bellamy (author of the \"\"Pledge of Allegiance\"\") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel \"\"Looking Backward\"\") and Charles Bellamy (author of \"\"A Moment of Madness\"\") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the \"\"Nationalism\"\" movement in the USA, the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association,\"\" and their dogma of \"\"military socialism,\"\" and Edward inspired the \"\"Nationalist Party\"\" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. \"\"Nazi\"\" means \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist\"\" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. \"\"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” \n",

It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.\"\" Wikipedia liars also used the painting \"\"The Oath of the Horatii\"\" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.\n",

The maximum QAM specified is 64QAM, which means there are 6 bits/symbol. Additionally we have 2x2 MIMO antenna technology which allows two parallel data layers (L). In total this results in: 100 RB * 12 SC * 2 TS * 7 ODFM-Symbols * 6 bit/Symbol * 2 L = 201,6 MBit/s (Absolute theoretical technical maximum DL data rate per 20 MHz carrier). [] (page 3).\n",
      "Now let's take a look at the UE categories. This information derives from the specification document 3GPP TS 36.213 [] (page 25 to 34): Let's take a look at table 7.1.7.1-1:\n",
      "Cat 4 Devices use coding scheme MCS28 for DL and MCS23 for UL. This leads to TBS Index 26 for DL and 21 for UL. Looking at table 7.1.7.2.1 we now look at N_PRB (# of Ressource Blocks) = 100 (corresponds to 20 MHz carrier). For the TCS indices above we find 75376 and 51024 respectively. This results in 51,024 MBit/s for the UL. For the downlink we have 2x2 MIMO, so there are 2 Layers. Corresponding to table 7.1.7.2.2: The available number of ressource blocks 75376 (SISO) translates to 149776 for 2x2 MIMO resulting in 149,776 MBit/s ~ 150 MBit/s. As can be seen this ist a bit less than the 2*75,376=150,752 MBit/s which are stated in the 3GPP UE table Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306.\n",
      "Cat 3 Devices use coding scheme MCS23 for DL and UL. So with the explanation above we find: 51024 resulting in 51,024 MBit/s for UL again and with 2x2 MIMO for DL 101,8 MBit/s or simply 2*51,024=102,048 MBit/s (Table 4.1-1 in TS 36.306).\n",
      "If we now reduce the carrier block size to 10 MHz - what happens? The amount of ressource blocks reduces from 100 to 50 - that's all. The MCS coding scheme stays the same. The conclusion is that a Cat4 device is able to achieve a theoretical troughput of 73,712 MBit/s with 10 MHz (50 RB) (Tables 7.1.7.2.1 & 7.1.7.2.2) of spectrum. Subsequently a Cat3 device in contrast can only reach 50,024 MBit/s according to these two tables and not around 75 MBit/s as previously discussed. I hope this clarified the issue so far. I doubt, that the development group is wrong here in their own specification.   20:26\n",

Firstly; Arthur Rubin. Have you looked at the laundry list of violations this \"\"admin.\"\" has racked up? Deleting other users posts on talk pages, tag team reverting, blocking, edit warring, being blocked etc. etc. etc. A short review of the section on my talk, brought to me by an IP editor too afraid to use their actual user-account informed me of his nefarious record here on Wikipedia. I refuse to walk into a known hostile article with hostile editors waiting to pounce like Subject Trolls. Who set this precedent of a hostile editing environment? Arthur Rubin, whose repeated rule-busting and counter-productive, antagonistic dancing around the issues leads only to toxic situations like this. I am NOT a push-over. Further, the editors in question,  and  make zero suggestions or concessions, oh but the \"\"undo\"\" button never fails to escape their attention.  How many times do I have to say this? These editors have the same stone-wall tactics and bad attitudes responsible for the grid lock in Washington D.C. where only the people/Wikipeia viewer are/is made to suffer. This is why, people like Arthur Rubin should not be a Wikipedia admin., this is why people like Arthur Rubin should not even so much as be Wikipedians. As of now, I will be writing an email to Wikipedia management and demanding his permanent dismissal and subsequent blocking of his most used IP. By the way, it has not escaped me that you haven't made one mention of the inability of either  or  violations of Common Sense or Wikipedia:Assume good faith cornerstones.

Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under \"\"POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing.\"\" To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44.

Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned.

When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain \"\"bulk\"\" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.\"\n",

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",

      "Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 – 28 December 1959) was Croatian fascist leader,[1] revolutionist[2] and politician.[3] He ruled as Poglavnik[note 1] of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia.[4] In the 1930s, he was a founding member and leader of the Croatian fascist[5] ultra-nationalist separatist movement, the Ustaše. In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Pavelić escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the \"\"puppet state\"\" tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   \"\n",

      "One of the things that bugs me about the writers who claim that the Midwest accent is the standard American accent is their fishbowl view. They view their own accent as the correct one. What do you think somebody from Georgia or Texas would think of that? Is this another \"\"to the victor goes the spoils\"\" from the Civil War? The north gets to have the \"\"correct\"\" accent? The population of southern speakers is barely a minority, I'd hate to be from Louisiana and hear some egomaniac from Iowa talk about his accent being the right one. It's like the woman who says the toilet seat should be down, even though 50% of the population uses it the other way, she thinks her way is the right way. Newscasters generally speak with a northern accent, I can attest to that, but they come from all over, and how many of them are deliberately trained to speak like a Midwesterner? I can't imagine such a thing. Would a newscaster from Albany NY or Seattle, or LA, or Connecticut, where people all have basically the standarn northern accent, need to change to some sort of cornfield Nebraska twang? Hell no. The Midwestern accent is not really typical anyway, I lived in Michigan for a year and people have an unusual accent there, not the typical newscaster accent. They say everything is \"\"the bomb,\"\" but they pronounce bomb as if it were spelled \"\"bahm.\"\" Their accent may be the bahm, but is NOT the standard way to pronounce things in journalism. I would say that of all the places in the USA that have the most neutral speach, that journalists would try to emulate, this region where I live beats out the Midwest for neutrality. Eastern upstate NY, from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse. Also Connecticut, they hae no trace of the New England weirdness that you see in Vermont or Maine, or most of Mass. And northwestern Mass has the Vermont accent. Very little of Mass is free of the weird New England thing. Worchester, forget it...very thick there. Probably the only accent-free part of Mass. is around Springfield, or southwestern Mass in general. That's like Connecticut, which is neutral. The Vermont accent is only found among the older people.

Not at all. As for the NYC accent, that only goes as far north as Peekskill unless you count all the transplanted NYC folks, especially after September 11, who moved upstate by the millions lately. As far north as Poughkeepsie, there are a good number of NYC folks that moved up, but the native Poughkeepsie people have the basic American accent, and the children of the NYC folks lose their accent in one generation. North or west of Albany, there are very few NYC transplants and no accent at all, except for the rednecks. And what can you do about the rednecks?  \"\n",

      "Groan. -) This is another one of those \"\"specialized usage vs general consistency\"\" dilemmas that comes up so often. Is WP a general encyclopedia that includes philatelic material, or a union of general and specialized encyclopedias? Secondly, is it a worthwhile effort to fight for a special exception to WP's usual practices? I would say not, because industry usage seems like more of a longstanding convention rather than a key point of fact (I've never seen an \"\"official\"\" explanation of the GB preference, for instance), and redirects work well enough to get people to our content (there should be category redirects irrespective of the name chosen). Deletion review or categories for discussion would be the right places to reopen, but based on past experience, \"\"everybody in philately uses GB\"\" alone is not going to be compelling enough to get an overturn.  \"\n",

First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.\n",
      "On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.\n",

Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.\n",

I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn't stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I'm reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that's often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I've missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.  The latter is what happened as I read this article.So this is my long-winded way of saying that perhaps forgetting the cast is part and parcel of the fact that so many people are involved.  Everyone's story is important, and you had to pick and choose what to include here.

The Wiki policy that I refer to, which is the focus of some people who focus more on their view of required format than they do on what is AWK, no doubt largely causes this problem.  I expect you don't have a problem with mention that someone is Latvian, say, in the lead ... and do not view that as AWK.  And, as you and our colleague in the above discussion point out, it was seem non-AWK to say \"\"Jewish\"\" or \"\"Jew\"\" either before or after the reference to Latvian.  But, where some people's reading of the Wiki format direction stops us from doing this, we are necessarily forced into a more awkward presentation.

Another group wishes to delete mention of the fact that people are Jewish if they believe it will help  or hurt  the image of Jews that they wish to propogate.  These two group, I expect, do not indicate what their true interest is, but cloak their arguments with psuedo-rationale argumentation.\n",

I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts.

      "Elonka - I understand that Verbal did not block me, but is it true that he had nothing to do with it? I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user's approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the 'proper' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal's standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal's aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal's overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He's not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That's not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It's quite clear that he's an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent.

Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.

There are also a variety of Jewish Christian groups, although there is no evidence Dylan belonged to a group that has been described as such.

As he has never conclusively subsequently officially renounced any form of Christianity, there is a good chance WP:BLP might enter into our moving him into Category:Former Christians or anything like that, because he has never himself that I know of described himself unequivocally in such terms. In short, this is still a matter of some ambiguity about the subject, particularly taking BLP into account, and I think the current categorization schema was arrived at after those really lengthy, and frankly extremely contentious, discussions.

Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.\n",

      "Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:\n",
      "Urbanathlete (Action Sports)\n",
      "This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)\n",
      "Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)\n",
      "Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.\n",
      "In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING\n",
      "Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”\n",

      "3) EQUIPMENT\n",
      "All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  \n",

      "A fiercely nationalistic book every American should read, August 5, 2002 \n",
      "\n",
      "This book was a million-seller in Japan, and was translated into English in 1991. The author was a promininet Japanese politician. The book is dated, and history has not always borne out the author's views. Nonetheless, anyone attempting to understand modern Japan should read it. Some of the passages will be very surprising and disturbing. \n",
      "Author Ishihara avoids the conventionally polite Japanese protocol and forcefully states that Japan is the equal of the United States, that Japan should have its own defense forces, (and strong ones), that Japanese computer technology is second to none and should be used as a negotiating tool, and Japan will be the most influential power in dealing with Asian nations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ishihara berates America for racism, and contends that the atomic bomb was not used on Germany because Germans were white, and Japanese were yellow. He asserts that nations colonized by Japan have been far more successful following liberation than those colonized by the United States. \n",
      "\n",
      "The book exemplifies the growing trend toward national pride in Japan, and also forcefully addresses the feeling by many Japanese that their nation is misunderstood. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plainly, the sentiments in the book foretell a troubled period in Japanese-American relations, and remind us that the Japanese have not forgotten Hiroshima any more than America has forgotten Pearl Harbor. Ishihara's call for a constructive dialogue between the two nations is well taken. Otherwise, the future looks cloudy at best. \n",

      "emblematic parochialism and obscure nationalist rage, September 19, 2006   \n",
      "\n",
      "I read this book in the CIA-translated version as a Senate aide concerned about the rise of Japan, which included as co-author one of the leaders of Sony (Morita). While interesting for scholars, as I glanced thru this version - which is watered down but still white hot with anger - I was struck at how far off base the predictions of the man seem today. Afterall, when it was written, Japan was at the crest of the bubble economy, it appeared as if Japanese computer chips (and its electronic industries) would confer great power on the country (they could refuse to sell components that went into US missiles), and the US was in a now-unimaginable phase of self doubt. As such, the way things have turned out, after nearly 16 years of stagnation and the rise of high tech manufacturer-competitors elsewhere, reveal the author to have been so badly mistaken regarding the trajectory that Japan would take as to be laughable. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a deeper sense, it points to the fact that Ishihara did not understand the economic forces at work at the time and so was full of utterly baseless nationalistic bravado. Japan's economic rise was based upon the post-war reconstruction boom, then a relatively protected economy that allowed huge undustrial combines to band together as cartels (gouging their won consumers to sell at low prices abroad to gain marketshare and crush competitiors), and lastly to a number of significant management innovations (TQM, just-in-time manufacturing, etc.) that are reflected in the fact that they make excellent cars. However, it was basically a follower economy making products that have become commoditized by cheaper manufacturers elsewhere in Asia - just as its innovations became widely emulated - and corrupted by the money generated in real estate speculation that eventually collapsed in a deflationary spiral. Meanwhile, its political reforms have been weak at best, and senselessly nationalistic at worst. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ishihara understood none of this and casts no light on any of it of value. Instead, he drags out pre-WWII arguments about the innate superiority of the Japanese character and similar rather ugly arguments. He is also appalingly loose with the facts: for example, he claims that the US bombed Japan, but not Germany with the atom bomb for racist reasons (Japanese were yellow, Germans were not) - but if you know a minimum of history, which Isihara apparently doesn't, you would realise that at the time of the German defeat (April, 1945) the bomb was not yet completed (it was first test detonated the following July)! The book is full of this kind of sloppiness. What he does succeed at, however, is expressing the resentment that parochial Japanese nationalists felt at the time. In retrospect, his arrogance appears as breathtaking as it is ignorant. But his anger and resentment, and what they reflect of Japanese attitudes, is very real indeed. Seen this way, the book is one long crypto-racist rant. \n",

      "1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. I have changed the repeated phrasing \"\"Most auxiliaries\"\" / \"\"Most modals\"\" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.\n",

West's sexual activity did not and was not.  Like other sex symbols of popular culture (e.g., Clara Bow, and you can probably think of some others), West was promiscuous and had a huge libido.

Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded.

If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the \"\"explanation\"\" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make \"\"heads and tails\"\" of.

So, maybe we need to start a discussion and approve a policy of article name STANDARDIZATION and PRECEDENT than can be followed in the future as they relate to ALL of these disparate yet related pages (Jews/Judaism in [country], History of Jews in [country], List of [national] Jews, all related to the standard category naming scheme \"\"Jews and Judaism in [country]\"\"). Per User:IZAK's recent moves involving the Swiss and Norwegian Jew articles I thought that this was and has been the accepted norm/precedent, but now I am being reverted for moving this article to its similar name, yet of course no one objects to IZAK's moves at all. If I am doing something wrong here, by all means please let me know  however, I am just trying to improve the overall naming and organizational scheme of this article and indeed all of the Category:Jews and Judaism by country (Judaism by country) articles/categories as a whole.\n",

A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.  Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited.

      "The most specific version I could find as that Picasso is supposed to have said this in 1937, replying to German ambassador Otto Abetz, as he was visiting Picasso's studio. Then there are versions that have Picasso handing out postcards (sometimes autographed, even) to Germans while making this quip, but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous German officer bringing/seeing a postcard/photograph. None of these sites mention sources, of course, but this one has an interesting addition:\n",
      "Picasso himself probably had contributed to Barr's and others' perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when, immediately following the liberation, he told an American correspondent for Newsweek magazine that on the day when a German army officer had recognized a sketch of Guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him, \"\"Did you do that?,\"\" Picasso coldly had replied, \"\"No, you did.\"\" \n",
      "Now the tale originates with Picasso himself and is told to Newsweek, which makes this version much more credible than the others, since it's hard to see how a response to Abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented, while it's equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous German officer could be known at all. Unfortunately, no other site corroborates the Newsweek detail. I've sent a mail to the Newsweek editors and I'll keep you posted. If someone could check out some Picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote (and what source they give, if any), that would be great.  13:14, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)\n",

Case in point: \"\"Do You Know Where You're Going To\"\" can easily be mentioned at Mahogany, without the need to create sepertate articles. Even though it was a number one hit, there's not enough information avaiable to write a full-fledged article on the song, and a stub repeats information already mentioned in the article for the movie. There is, and has to be, a cut-off as far as what gets included here, and what doesn't: something like a full Stevie Wonder discography, with an article for every single he's ever recorded, is far beyond the scope of the encyclopedia.

The British backed down because of threats by T.E. Roosevelt that he would invade and annex British Columbia if he didn't get his way.

      "\n",
      "There are two sticking points remaining in the Alaska Boundary Settlement.  One is that the treaty stipulates that the western shoreline of the Portland Canal is the boundary; US maps continue to show mid-channel.  Similarly with the A-B Line, which is between Point A and Point B on the north side of the Dixon Entrance; US maps show the boundary as being mid-Dixon Entrance, and the US/Alaska have even issued oil/drilling-exploration permits on \"\"their\"\" side of that line.\n",

      "Same kind of fudge-up with the Oregon Treaty; during the Salmon War of the mid-1990s Canadian commercial vessels (whale watching boats) were busted by US Coast Guard in the area of the San Juans; but the treaty is very clear that ALL commercial vessels south of the 49th Parallel are to be unhindered; that would even include in Rosario Strait, far from the current border in the Haro Strait; during the same kafuffle Sen. Slade Gorton (State-Sen) in Washington invoked the treaty to demand free passage through the Johnstone Strait for American fishing vessels (nothing of the kind is guaranteed in the Oregon Treaty, or for that matter in the Alaska treaty either) and called on the US Navy to enforce the \"\"international waterway\"\" (which is all of a mile wide in spots).  Thing is it was the US who passed legislation that attacked non-American ships using this route, i.e. the act that makes it so that preference is given to vessels sailing from American port to American port over those from a \"\"foreign port\"\" to an American port; this act was passed specifically to route the Yukon shipping trade through Seattle over Vancouver, even though it was Canadian/British waters that the route traversed. \n",

      "The Catholic Church example is a good one, but I'd like to point out several key distinctions. First off, its an old enough institution that a separate History of the Catholic Church article exists, which makes the main article in reality The current status of the Catholic Church or maybe A summary of the Catholic Church, this is not the case for the NRA. We have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities, so the Lead needs to reflect that. Second, with all of the various controversy involving the Church, none of it mentioned until the last paragraph. Third, it's Lead 1st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has. I would be fine with something similar, \"\"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization with 5 million members.\"\" But quite frankly, that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, if we take a clinical look at what they do today, its a variety of things that range from publishing and multi-media (television, internet, etc.) to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities. So to describe the organization in the 1st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes \"\"gun control\"\", gun rights\"\", or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article, hence my original suggestion for the Lead first sentence. At the very least, I don't see why the first sentence can't just be generically descriptive. Maybe something like, \"\"The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities. Originally founded in 1871 in New York by journal editor William Conant Church and General George Wood Wingate to promote marksmanship within the United States military, the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals. In the 21st century, it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in Washington D.C. as well as a large, multi-title magazine publisher, an advocate for hunters, outdoorsmen, and the , and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the U.S.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I will try to find other examples, but given this list (:Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations) it does not seem difficult to find an article with a Lead first sentence like I've described. By the way, I'm advocating for a rewrite of the ENTIRE WP:Lead, not just the 1st sentence. I think that Policy is fairly clear, but IMO to adhere to it properly in this case Editor's need, to quote the WP:Lead page, a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a NPOV manner that a non-specialist will understand. This is something beyond what a magazine subscription or occasional mailing will provide.  (Talk) ☮ღ☺ \"\n",

The first Kannada literary work Kavirajamarga was created in 850 AD and it refers to some writings earlier than that. The 12th Centaury Kannada Bhakti Movement in the form of Vachana or oral expression is unparallel. In contemporary kirtana which subsequently became Karnataka Sangeet is an enduring contribution to Indian music. Sir, the epigraphical material in Kannada, numbering over 25,000 inscriptions in stone and copper, are rich in style and contents, which are not found even in Tamil inscription.

      "One of my great passions in life is learning about a broad variety of different topics: computer sciences, physics in a general sense, world history, geography, biological life, etc. But above all else, I am extremely passionate about human rights. In the most general sense, I support freedom for everyone, regardless of their life situation. With regards to most of the causes that I support, not only have I taken the time to read about them on the side, but I've also followed news developments pertaining to them very closely. For example, I oppose the ruling family of Saudi Arabia because of their hardline Islamist ideology and authoritarian methods. To start with, I consider Saudi Arabia guilty of gender apartheid against its women, who aren't even allowed to leave the house without wearing an abaya and being in the company of a male consort. It's the only country in the world where women are not permitted to drive. They are also known for severely discriminating against expatriate workers from throughout Asia and Africa, abuses against the Shiite community in the Eastern Province, and publicly beheading people for nonviolent offences — they literally still perform executions on charges of witchcraft and sorcery.\n",
      "And that's just the tip of the iceberg in a laundry list of reasons why I detest the Saudi monarchy. What makes it worse is the fact that there doesn't seem to be any outrage over their human rights record, which deeply troubles me.\n",
      "Granted, I don't think Saudi Arabia is a controversial state to denounce. Some of the ones I've listed are no-brainers to most people: a free Burma, the end of totalitarianism in North Korea, etc. But then there's the more divisive issues, such as Kosovar independence or the Syrian civil war. I have been following the latter since before the uprising even began in March 2011; already very familiar with the human rights situation in Syria, I was fully anticipating the Arab Spring to arrive there sooner or later. I also knew it would be far more complicated than any other Arab country, if for no other reason than for the fact that it has a society divided along sectarian lines. I support the downfall of Bashar al-Assad. I believe that he and his regime have committed large-scale crimes against humanity for the sake of retaining power (yes, I do think he deployed sarin gas in Ghouta). However, unlike many others, I do not see opposition to Assad as being mutually exclusive from opposition to al-Qaeda and its affiliates, including its Syrian branch Al-Nusra. They too have committed atrocities, specifically against the Christians and Alawites. The long and short of it is, I support a free, democratic, and secular Syria. Easier said than done, but it never hurts to be optimistic. Now, Kosovo is an entirely different story. The region has a very complicated history, especially during the existence of Yugoslavia as an independent state. I'll spare you the lengthy explanation of the context, the situation after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the guerrilla war conducted by the terroristic Kosovo Liberation Army against ethnic Serbs, the resulting ethnic cleansing campaign against the Kosovar Albanians conducted by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, the UN presence in Kosovo, the 2008 declaration of independence, etc. All you need to know, as it pertains to my support of Kosovar independence, is the fact that the vast majority of people in Kosovo support it. Everything else is immaterial to me; it's what the people want that I care about. The issue of Kosovar Serbs should be resolved through negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo. Those are just two examples of my less popular stances.\n",

You say that I should \"\"accept the rules\"\" when other editors are totally disregarding and/or misquoting them, or trying to pass off essays and guidelines as policy when they are not. The fact is that if someone is removing good/valid/sourced material from Wikipedia, I'm going to call them out on it.

For whatever reason, entirely valid, relevant, and sourced material is consistently removed from many articles (Paul Wolfowitz, Ben Bernanke, Lewis Libby, others) by the same editors again and again, and after a while it just gets very old, ridiculous, and frustrating to have to keep inserting this valid information over and over. By the way: I consider the removal of valid material/categories from articles over and over again to be censorship and vandalism...don't you?

However, when I see factual edits constantly being reverted for no apparent reason (what I term censorship and vandalism) it tends to make me a bit angry, so I have no choice except to be vocal about it and hope that other good editors see what is happening and will begin to take action and discuss these issues. That's another thing...the complete and utter lack of discussion by these people, whether in edit summaries or on talk pages.

      "HHHH Here is a clarification. The original Semitic people came from Arabia, they moved north and east. After time, the Semitic people devised many dialects of \"\"Semitic\"\". Those dialects became known as \"\"Languages\"\" after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic & for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab. Yet Maternaly they would have had a greater affinity to the other Arab tribes. by BB\"\n",

      "So you wrote yourself: this article is more than just recognition. I write that it is also about illegal precedent... if not only about it. I myself comprehend the term recognition as a term which explains a process. Wiktionary for the english language for (Wikt:recognition) states as the first definition that it is an act or condition of being recognized, whereas wikt:recognize explains this transitive verb as To match something or someone which one currently perceives to a memory of some previous encounter with the same entity. So if we follow the literate meaning we could conclude that to make an act of recognition or come to the state of recognition one should match sth... ...with the same entity. What should should be matched here: eventual Kosovo independence with independence of othere countries. If there are some lists, which you mention, then there are lists of independent (or better nondependant) countries and other entities. Since there is a dispute whether Kosovo should be in one list or some other, some major (as in comparative of lat. magnus - en. bigger) thoughts could be given here. If you mention moving (from one list to the other, than you intuitively agree with me that there could be a POV that a process could exist, or not. Moving, by itself, is a dynamic category (Aristotel discussed this issue long ago), so it could be perceived and comprehended as a process. All this is much simpler (at least for me) to comprehend and explain in serbian language, since serbian language has svršeni and nesvršeni vid of a verb which adds to a bit more refined expression of thought, if I may be so language-subjective. Sorry if I offended you somehow, by quoting your words or in any other way, it wasn't my intention.

I realize that its easier to combine many of these groups into a general idea when talking about them, but thinking of the larger International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders, which is really more of a movement, as the same thing as al Qaeda, is perhaps too much of a generalization. You could generalize the World Islamic Front as loose enough to be the same thing as the International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders except that the World Islamic Front only has Islamic members.

Felix Mendelssohn was very ostensibly a Christian composer who wrote a great deal of church music, much of which is used liturgically today. If he was a convert, like Mahler, then it might be reasonable to categorise him as Jewish, in that he would have been Jewish for part of his life. However, he was not. He was baptised as a Christian having been born to Christian parents.

The article is starting to come together, and I plan to begin working on filling in the {Winners} tables with the 1979-1995 winners.  I'm still not really convinced the page even needs the \"\"Winners\"\" tables, since the ceremony is equally dedicated to awarding television actors (if not more so) and the categories have changed so much over the years it would be impossible to efficiently list all the winners in the various categories that have popped up and disappeared over the years: Dramatic Films, Comedy Films, Action-Adventure Films, and then the \"\"splitting\"\" of categories into age groups, etc. It gets pretty convoluted, so I think it might be a better idea to use the \"\"Winners\"\" section to mention some of the notable former child stars who were nominated for or won a Young Artist Award and then went on to receive  acclaim as adults, but for now I think the tables that are on the page should at least be complete, so I'll be working on that next.

I have stated ad infinitim et nauseum that he was not in any way made a slave, when viewed through any lens of the time, no matter how many oxymoronic historians state otherwise.  Slaves were specifically identified by the edicts of 1618 (as \"\"slaves to the Colony\"\"), by the slave traders and, most significantly, by the slaves themselves, especially those who converted to Christianity as slaves on board the early 17th C ships for the sole person of not being treated as slaves upon their arrival in the new world.  I'm tired of trying to argue the facts with a brick wall, except to ask you, , if I were to write what two other, reliable sources had considered in publications...  \"\"Scoobydunk is a brick wall,\"\" would you be able to find two reliable sources, which specifically stated, as if to state the obvious for no apparent reason, \"\"Scoobydunk is not a brick wall?\"\"  I rest my case.]  They've also failed to provide any reliable source to claim there were slaves recognized and officially documented by a legal institution before Punch.

      "Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: \"\"All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment.\"\" In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brunton's beginning point is that: \"\"The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is \"\"a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks\"\" is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The \"\"spiritual bypass\"\" is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ. \n",

Structural geology is the study of structures (folds, faults, etc) within the rocks at scales varying from microscopic to continental. Now of course they are interrelated. Essentially, landforms are the product of erosive processes on the existing structure of the rocks involved and cannot be understood or explained without a good understanding of the geologic structure of the rocks. A geologist trying to decipher the structural geology of a region begins by studying the clues in the landforms. All is related. Now, there is a tendency of some geographers to think that geomorphology is a subdivision of geography and try to explain landforms without a thorough understanding of the structure, petrology, and stratigraphy on which the surface landforms develop. Landforms cannot be understood without knowledge of the geology on which they are formed.\n",

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",

Then we also appear more moral historically.\"\"\n",

Once we admit they were 2 separate wars, then it all makes more sense and make us look all the more moral.\"\"\n",

That a small group of editors attempted to override that in one category is improper because it leads to inconsistency and violation of neutral treatment of subjects.

The other aspect is the actual issue of the stamps for postal purposes and this is all done at the behest of a postal authority (on the chicken before egg principle).  Anything to do with issuing stamps and organising collection, sorting and delivery of mail is done by a postal authority which is why we believe it must rank as a main sub-category along with “physical” philately.

      "Research shows that one of the most prominent characteristics of infant directed speech is the wider opening of the mouth that is present in those using infant directed speech versus adult directed speech.  This differences occurs especially in vowels.  Vocal pitch is also heightened during infant directed speech and research indicates vowels are spoken with the highest pitch when infant directed speech is used.  The horizontal positioning of the lips in infant directed speech does not differ significantly from positioning used in adult directed speech.  Instead, the only observed difference remains in vertical lip positioning.  By making the opening of the lips larger, infants are more likely to focus on the face of the speaker.  Research suggests that the larger the opening of the lips during infant directed speech, the better infants will understand the message being conveyed due to the additional visual cues available.  The intensity of speech, however, does not differ from that used in adult directed speech contrary to popular belief.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Infant directed speech does not only include the characteristics of high pitched speech and elongated syllables, but also incorporates visual body movements that assist in conveying meaning of language to infants.  One monumental visual aspect of infant directed speech is the movement of the lips.  In addition, head movements are used to emphasize various syllables within language production.  These visual cues provide infants the additional information needed to perform accurate speech discrimination during language development.  Further, visual cues allow infants to discriminate speech differences in environments in which they cannot rely on their hearing, such as in noisy environments.  The auditory and visual aspects of infant directed speech do not exist independently, however.  Infants rely equally on both methods of understanding and as development continues, infants strengthen the link between these two important categories.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It must be considered that although infant directed speech features marked characteristics, it may not only be these characteristics aiding in development of language for children.  Due to the visual cues used  by caregivers in this method of communication, infants are more highly motivated to engage in communication.  Because infants are willing to participate in this process, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of infant directed speech.  \n",

      "It is often assumed that infants are interested in the properties of infant directed speech and play a passive role in this interaction.  However, research indicates that infants are not only attracted to the practice itself but to people who engage in infant directed speech.  Through this practice, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development.  When infants use infant directed speech as a determinant of acceptable caregivers their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants.\n",

Sure the British were impressing \"\"American\"\" subjects into the Royal Navy and the NATIVE AMERICANS were at times hostile but the Americans weren't saints. To be honest the War of 1812 was one of the biggest disasters America has faced - their invasion of Canada bloodily repulsed, Native Americans supported by the British and Canadians, A British Army torching Washington DC (in retaliation for the torching of York during the winter season) and ending up marching at will around central america doing what they wanted until a peace treaty was signed. American prestige was only \"\"restored\"\" after a meaningless battle in New Orelans AFTER THE WAR ENDED. Regardless of what people say, this war did not prove Young America could hold their own against the old world, it showed they bit off more than they could chew in attempting to subjugate and forcibly liberate Canada against the populace's will. Don't forget half the canadian population were loyalists during the American revolution and Britain was fighting the might of Napoleon in Europe, so the War of 1812 was something of a sideline campaign. I may have rattled on a bit here butI think it just goes to show that that section needs rewriting to seem something other than some super-american-patriotic propaganda machine.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.136.246.144   \n",

I note your failure to WP:AGF for my edit and your accusation of nationalistic bias. Let me talk you through my process: I had seen that an editor (turns out to have been you) had consolidated the Cymru and Wales entries, but had made an error in the process (the one I corrected). I noticed the union flag had been added - which had not been on the Cymru entry previously - and that other (non-sovereign) countries (visible from W down) do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them. e.g: Wake Island (territory of the United States of America)Wallis and Futuna (territory of France)Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic)I went to the beginning of the article to check that other (non-sovereign) countries do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them either. e.g.: Åland (autonomous province of Finland):American Samoa (territory of the United States of America):Anguilla (overseas territory of the United Kingdom):Aruba (territory of Netherlands)Therefore, as far as I could tell (although I concede that I should have checked the entire article for British nationalist bias), additional, sovereign state flag icons were not used on the article, and the one on the Wales entry was therefore unnecessary, which is why I removed it - thus tidying the article. That is how I found \"\"the cheek to refer to [your] restoration of the previous status quo as \"\"removing edits [you] just don't like\"\" and as a \"\"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response\"\".\"\" Which seems justified.

If an article of 1,000 lines has a link repeated on line 600 there is no objection to keep te second link. A link repeated three times in the same paragraph is just plain overkill. Any undesirable future edits (removal of templates) should be adressed by closely monitoring your watchlist, not placing an excessive amount of duplicate links.\n",

Imperial versus metric, inch versus foot and inch, alphabetic versus historical order, etc. Using other units for Railgauge templates than its corresponding categories and article titles makes it harder to recognise a particular Railgauge when editing or reading text, especially for people accustomed to metric systems. When the list of track gauges, navbox track gauges, article titles and categories all mention 3ft 6in it is odd to use the devious 42in RailGauge template.

What an AfD is for is to get a page that you genuinely think fails to cover an encyclopedic topic removed from Wikipedia.  It is not a way to express displeasure with particular editors of that page.  It is not a way to push the idea that the page would be better if modified in some fashion.

Anyway, I think you've concluded basically the same thing I have: such a broadening of definition would include many people who really should not be considered philosophers.  Consider, for instance, Ayn Rand.  She wrote on the topics of metaphysics, ethics, etc, but she did so rhetorically and without actually attempting to prove her points using syllogistic logic.  She contributed nothing to human knowledge, both because her reasoning was fallacious and because any of her actually valid conclusions had already been documented by previous philosophers (for instance, \"\"objectivist\"\" metaphysics are simply a renamed naturalistic metaphysics).  I don't mean to group Dawkins with Rand of course as Dawkins is, in my opinion, a brilliant man who has contributed much to human knowledge.  But this is my point: using such a broadened definition puts Dawkins, Rand, Kant, Mill, and Russel in the same category, which I think is prima facie an incorrect grouping.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as to your point that philosophers will favor their own: well yes, but the same should be said for biologists and physicists.  When we write an article on evolution we value the discoveries of biology and not of religion.  Philosophy is and basically always has been an academic enterprise, starting with the post-religious works of the Sophists/Plato/Aristotle/etc as they founded the world's first philosophical academies.  Since then the practice of philosophy has undergone many manifestations but even among those differences it is generally somewhat easy to tell what is philosophy and what is simply on the subject of philosophy but not actually philosophy.  For instance, the analytical school of philosophy, I think, should not hesitate to consider continental philosophy something other than philosophy, it is just considered to be incorrect (being very general here).  From a Wikipedia standpoint, encyclopedias themselves are an academic enterprise and as such when we're considering how to assign WP:WEIGHT to a subject we do so by reference to experts in that subject.  Whether rightly or wrongly, the experts on philosophy have yet to recognize Dawkins as a philosopher, but as WP editors our job is not to determine whether or not Dawkins is really a philosopher, but rather to consider the expert opinion on the matter and give due weight to minority views when appropriate. talk \"\n",

I don't know if you're Wikignoming because you lack the time or resources to expand articles or if it's just something you prefer to do, but there's certainly other stuff that you can be profitably be doing. Ship article titles need to have the ship's name in italics or you could focus on improving their categorization, neither of which I tend to remember to do anything about. Adding convert templates to articles is certainly worthwhile, although I'd suggest you limit your preference for always abbreviating everything. For one thing, I like to show the hyphen form of a compound adjective like 15-inch gun, something that abbreviating eliminates. You could ensure that articles written in AmEnglish use American spelling of units and vice versa; just be sure not to change the type of English unless there are strong national connections like RN ships use BritEng or USN ships use AmEng. Articles on non-English speaking navies' ships have no national connection and can be written in either form; just be sure that it's consistent within the article.

It has been said that the sole reason for Irvington's recent development in that category is the transfer of students from Weibel Elementary School. However, while it's obvious Weibel Elementary School has made a positive change on Irvington's test scores, Weibel Elementary School is only a small portion of Irvington's students. A much greater possibility is that students from other schools served as examples, and the inspiration was enough to raise Irvington's academic achievement. \n",

Both are middle to upper middle class, with the housing tracks in Weibel being slightly newer than the older housing track of Irvington district. While the Weibel neighborhood benefited from the high tax revenues of other parts of mission san jose district, very little seperates the two area other than a larger working class population in the Irvington district as a result of the pre-silcon valley economies in which many autoworkers from Genreal Motors in Fremont, Peterbuilt, Trail Mobile, and Caterpillar in Newark,Ca, and Ford Motors in Milpitas,CA resided in the Irvington district. However, as Unionized laborers these workers made a good wage for the time, maybe as well of a living as those currently in the Weibel neighborhood given inflation and cost of living in California of the 1970's and 1980's. \n",

      "\n",
      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",
      "\n",
      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \n",

      "Worship Rights \n",
      "\n",
      "In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” \n",

      "\"::I would say that the process of \"\"lumping\"\" and \"\"splitting\"\" is intimately connected to phylogenetics (not to cladistics) by the fact that reality is ambiguous, both in a momentary and in a historical perspective. This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]\n",

And we're to take this on the word of someone who has been lambasting unaccredited institutions across the Internet for decades, who can't find a single like-minded editor other than an admin with whom he shares 90% of their joint editing activity on articles dealing with unaccredited institutions.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",

      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",

      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",

      "In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \n",

      "The mass of a space tether goes up with length.  Assuming it could take the thermal environment, you can build a space tether out of kite string.  But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string.  This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends.  Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass.  You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth, hence not practical.  That doesn't mean that you still can't use that kite string to fly a kite, obviously you can.  The difference is in the length.  The space elevator is 100,000 km long.  Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most.  The same applies to skyhooks.  You could build a 100,000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn't practical.  But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite, a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4,000 km range is possible.\n",
      "As to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that.  You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded.  References 7, 18, and 19 are open source.  Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non-rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper.  If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google, it is open source.  \n",
      "Quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it.  You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers.  For that I recommend the \"\"Tether in Space Handbook\"\", it is also open source on the internet, see reference 7.\n",

      "1) \"\"His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth, achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5.0 km/s (16 kft/s or Mach 16) airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass.\"\"\n",

      "\n",
      "4.0 km/s is 51% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic.  Again no disagreement.\n",

      "The tether tip speeds for the non-rotating skyhook examples in this article, and in all the references I have listed, start at 96% of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70% of low Earth orbit velocity.  There is no reason to go any lower.\n",
      "As a result, the final line of the Boeing quote, \"\"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts. \"\" does not apply for two reasons.  1) It doesn't apply to the skyhook lengths in the article, and 2) it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks.\n",

It is a logical error of equivocation when a word which can, under some circumstances and under some conditions, mean the the same as some other specified word, is arbitrarily employed as a substitute for that other specified word. This is an equivocation you continue to make with the word \"\"try\"\", which has validity when applied to natural phenomena only in a metaphoric sense, which is a usage disallowed in logic and science. I provided you with a dictionary definition of the word \"\"try\"\" which includes \"\"volition\"\", which \"\"Nature\"\" clearly does not have. Your statement that \"\"I also suspect the scenario was presented to us students just to make us think\"\" implies an awareness on your part that the case was hypothetical, which indicates that the uses of the word \"\"try\"\" (and effort with an implication of volition) was not meant literally. Need I remind you that half remembered arguments from long forgotten books (and/or lectures) does not count for evidence? The fact that the word \"\"try\"\" includes the meaning \"\"effort\"\" does not mean that these two words can be arbitrarily substituted one for the other. To make such substitution without providing a case for its validity in the specific case at hand is to commit the logical fallacy of equivocation, especially when the equivocation is being employed as a means of proving that something which can be true is true. In these cases, equivocation is also the logical fallacy of question begging. As previously mentioned, the concept \"\"Anything not forbidden is allowed\"\" has a long pedigree in various legal fields, such as - but not limited to and without prejudice - Judaism and English common law. I suggest you familiarize yourself with these arguments before continuing our current discussion.\n",

If the blastocyst can be shown to have volition, it can be shown to have personhood) It is therefore covered under the general declaration \"\"Nature\"\" has no volition\"\", variants of which I have repeatedly made, and therefore does not \"\"try'. Unless you are going to try to prove that a blastocyst has volition, your example has been dealt with. I will not address each and every example of natural phenomena \"\"trying\"\" anything, except to the extent that naturally occurring sentient beings have volition. The salient feature of naturally occurring reasonable sentient beings is the fact that we are able to self-consciously intervene directly in the chain of cause and effect which governs the existence of all other natural phenomena. That is why man made laws exist in a category discrete from natural laws, and why applying laws found in natural philosophy (now known as science) to man made laws such as rights is a category error. Feynman himself, upon whose argument you rely, recognizes this. When he states that social science is pseudo-science and not science, he is placing the two phenomena into different, largely irreconcilable, categories. He denies outright that social sciences have discovered any testable laws. Your entire case rests on this category error, on your equivocation error in your use of the word \"\"try\"\", and in your equivocation error in your uses of the words \"\"mandatory\"\" and \"\"allowed\"\". You have no case; and, at this point, you are beginning to look like a troll rather than a good faith debater. i will not go round this mulberry bush with you much longer.\n",

It is about global health but again not about Medical Tourism which is a subcategory of globalized healthcare driven by the patient movement. For example the reference article starts with the example of Dave who had traveled to Tanzania as a part of global health rotation. In this case, Tanzania is neither the medical destination nor the developed country with collapsed or collapsing social health care system therefore no interest to medical tourism studies. It is clearly not relevant to the medical tourism. I think if medical tourism would be defined with economics terms such as imports and exports (by the way I do not like it in this way, just to clarify), we might not be so confused.

Aside from the usual issue of no one ever having fully bothered to create a decent consensus on mood as a category and within that a standardized naming scheme for moods, the biggest problem I have with most of these sources is that they seem to assume that non-do expressions of emphatic mood via emphasis of other elements is understood, yet none of them actually include such a statement asserting such.  Mulvey refers to such expression in addition to do via auxiliaries in general with examples of emphatic 'will', 'be' and a few others, all established by providing vocal emphasis to those elements.  Beard lists emphatic mood along with a slew of other functions conveyed via auxiliary verbs in general, but doesn't preclude the emphatic (nor any of the other things he's listed) from non-auxiliary expression.  Huddleston seems to infer the use of emphasis in conveying emphatic mood by referring to examples that include neither do nor other auxiliaries, but since he doesn't actually explicitly mark his examples for whatever he is referring to them doing (I suppose he thinks his observations are obvious in each), there's no concrete way of knowing precisely what he is pointing to.  Google turns up thousands of grammars, ESL primers, and language learning websites that all discuss the use of do in conveying the emphatic mood but again just seem to assume the reader knows that emphasis is the means while (when needed) do is the vehicle.  Their wording seems to again point to some presupposed awareness that stressing the desired element is how you convey the emphatic, usually showing examples with non-verbal elements and then other auxiliaries emphasized before stating that do-support comes into play when no other auxiliary is present.  They also provide zero sources so are worth little more than reference value.  \"\n",

      "A little history on this article. Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category \"\"Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)\"\" [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a \"\"specialist\"\" would understand what type of saddle a \"\"kura\"\" was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category \"\"Saddles by type\"\" and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a \"\"Kura\"\" was, with the word \"\"Japanese\"\" added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a \"\"Kura\"\" was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.\n",
      "I have seen \"\"precision\"\" mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled \"\"Precision and disambiguation\"\", WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article \"\"Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle? The only difference is some brackets. Here is a quote \"\"Precision – Titles usually use names and terms that are precise (see below), but only as precise as necessary to identify the topic of the article unambiguously.\"\" WP:NAMINGCRITERIA, the title \"\"Kura (saddle) not \"\"precise\"\" as it does not actually identify what type of saddle this is to the \"\"general reader\"\", I would rather have the article named \"\"Japanese saddle\"\" than \"\"Kura (saddle) so that anyone will know instantly what type of saddle this article is about if it is necessary to change the articles title, at least the \"\"general reader\"\" would be able to know what the article is about without having to click on the title as they would with Kura (saddle).    \"\n",

Not even mind sometimes, since my edit history is filled with self-reverts.) You are wrong about \"\"can't take it back\"\", since any self-revert does just that, and self-reverts are permitted, Mr. Mann jess. Again, it is just a matter of opinion whether my edits were improvements or disimprovements. It isn't an objective thing as you portend to assert. I don't have any \"\"feud\"\" with you, Mann jess.

      "\n",
      "Consider this quote by the currently popular guru, Ramana Maharshi: “Repetition aloud of His name is better than praise. Better still is its faint murmur. But the best is repetition within the mind — and that is meditation. Better than such broken thought is its steady and continuous flow like the flow of oil or of a perennial stream.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ramana Maharshi’s statement represents mantra meditation’s goal: a state where the mind is timelessly identified with surrender to the name of one’s god – identical with the god himself. The mind itself has become self-negation at the feet of the deity. Empty of original thought and dynamic desire, the “liberated” person’s ego is dissolved: the very thing that made him or her human. All that is left is a mind-body shell, a meat-robot, that moves through life as a surrendered instrument of some greater will. I suggest the greater will is not that of the Infinite. It is the will of the god who has taken the place of one’s mind...\n",

What is that light in their eye, a light beyond this world? Whose is that power they touch you with, embrace you with? Is it the shakti of Brahman, the light of pure consciousness? Or is it the power of Kali or one of her friends? Gurus often say they are the embodiment of Shiva, Kali, or some other god. Why do we not take them at their word?\n",

This explains the common phenomenon of proselytizing by the religious, including fundamentalist Christians, TMers, and disciples of other varieties.

The god that moves through them fills them with this zeal, as a hungry stomach fills the mind with an overwhelming need to procure dinner.\n",

The sun shines by itself as an entity with its own consciousness. The rain and wind don’t need a god to direct them; they move where they will in harmony with their fellow elements. All things are children of the Infinite, spirits or egos in their own unique right, expressing in physical form and also in astral dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gods are spirits/egos like everybody else. Most of the time they dwell on astral planes, which is why human senses normally don’t perceive them. According to ancient records, they have visited the earth in ages past in physical forms of their own, as entities from the stars.\n",

Everyone can do it. Everyone is equally powerful moving and creating in the depths of their own consciousness.\n",

      "This is actually a quite controversial case, though I admit that the label Belgian is a little misleading, \"\"Trappist Quadrupel\"\" is not so bad. Stan Heironymous, in his very well researched book on Belgian Brewing \"\"Brew Like A Monk\"\", writes about La Trappe, which was briefly a trappist brewery in the Netherlands and had the appellation revoked when it sold to a Dutch Brewing company. According to those that sold, the problem was simply maintaining an order of monks. They did produce a beer which they called a Quadrupel. Moreover, Quadrupel has become a label on some american beers obviously of Belgian inspiration (and using derivatives of trappist yeast.) While this arguably makes Quadrupel not a style, Quadrupel is not listed as a style per say, but one of the myriad \"\"specialized\"\" belgian ales.\n",

Yes, the BJCP styles include some catch all categories that aren't rightly considered styles, but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn't not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer. Since the guidelines are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader, I think they're great.

The answer is simple: because she's African American and skin colors range all across the board in the African American community.

If you did reach out to Clan Davidson, that was a wise thing to do. Who they say they descend from carries much more weight than others who might have an interest in slandering their name.

However, we are strictly talking YDNA here and it would be nice if the current chiefly line would consider testing, and perhaps one of his sons will, or a cousin...we'll have to see.

      "Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song \"\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\"\". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\". I like the \"\"problem solved\"\" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "TV Tropes has already suffered an edit war because of her, so much so they forbade users from writting what Belle's eye color is. Notice how Belle's name is missing from the Eye Color tropes colony, while the rest of Disney Princesses have their eye color mentioned. Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",

      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",

They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as \"\"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive\"\". Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to \"\"be Serb\"\" if they do not feel so and never declare as such.\n",

In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the \"\"Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'\"\" This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.\n",

If we put only one viewpoint in \"\"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church\"\" it is not balanced.

As it states at Wikipedia:Stub, at the top of most stub categories, and in many other places on Wikipedia, it is recommended that new stub types are proposed prior to creation at Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals, in order to check whether the new stub type is already covered by existing stub types, whether it is named according to stub naming guidelines, whether it is otherwise correctly formatted, whether it reaches the standard threshold for creation of a new stub type, and whether it crosses existing stub type hierarchies. Your new stub type is currently listed at WP:WSS/D - please feel free to make any comments there as to any rationale for this stub type. And please, in future, consider proposing new stub types first!.

      "Hi, I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information. I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being;\n",

      "I would also like to state the very first reference to eyes ever being compared to the colour 'hazel' was by William Shakespeare in Romeo & Juliet in which he was comparing a persons eyes to the reddish brown colour of a ripe hazelnut; Mercutio: “Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;–what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?” Act 3.

      "Considering William Shakespeare was an English writer it does prove the original intension/purpose of calling a persons eyes the colour hazel was to compare them to the colouration of either a light golden brown hazelnut or a reddish darker brown hazelnut and never a green and gold/brown mix or any multi-coloured eye (blue, grey or green with brown around the pupil) as a hazelnut doesn't present any blue, grey or green colouration nor is the colour 'hazel' described as possessing any of these colours. I only hope you're more understanding of this issue and can agree with what i'm saying, I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understand/know about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth. That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isn't green or gold in any way it's actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil, the hazel eye section doesn't say anything about haz\n",
      "\":: One thing that I think is relevant to mention is that the article dedicated towards \"\"third gender\"\" is being debated at this time. The issue surrounds whether it is deserving of it's own article or if it would better fit into the category of gender. I think that after reading the existing entry on gender and debates regarding cultural approaches to the issue that the combination of gender and third gender would remedy two issues and make for a much more comprehensive article regarding the subject of gender as a whole.\n",

Already in the Introit of his book Jesus was Caesar it is clearly stated that: To anticipate the result: Jesus proves to be Divus Iulius, the deified Caesar, passed down in tradition. The word he uses for this finding is 'disclosure'. So it is wrong to write he 'proposes' or 'claims'. 'Theory' was therefore the best compromise, but the respectable User:Slrubenstein and other distorters don't like that. It should be noted here that User:Slrubenstein has not bothered to explain and discuss on this talk page why he egomaniacally altered the status quo and threatened other users who maintained 'theory' with blockage which was later carried out.

      "I'm not sure that what they think they are doing is correct - it would be what they say they think they are doing, and reliable sources suggest that what they say they think they are doing is misleading.  The recent APA report says that what they say they think they are doing is not what is happening.  They say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction.  The APA has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these.  I don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally.  They feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities.  The only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the APA has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion.  It is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.

      "\n",
      "User:PiCo, I will desist from making edits in this current article, since I feel my input might be misconstrued or disruptive, and that, of course, would not be my intent. However, please be apprised that there is a vast disparity between the traditional Jewish method of calibrating years based on a carefully guarded oral tradition, as opposed to modern methods used primarily by Christians who rely heavily upon the modern academic methods applied in dating chronology. The two are still reconcilable, but it will take a vast amount of effort and a person of \"\"long wind\"\" (patience) and extreme diligence to even begin to explain where the discrepancies have \"\"crept-in\"\" to ancient chronologies. The Jews insist that there were only 210 years of slavery in Egypt, although the 430 years mentioned in the Hebrew Bible are merely counted from the time of Isaac's birth, until the departure of Israel from Egypt. You see, \"\"strangers in a land not theirs,\"\" really begins with Abraham's seed in the land of Canaan. Anyway, my view is not to interrupt your work, but to let it proceed on course. I would, however, have preferred to see you mention more about the \"\"other method\"\" practiced by mainstream Judaism, whether it is accepted or not by Christian or academic circles. This would have given more balance to the current article. I have an inkling that someone will eventually start another article dealing only the Jewish tradition of biblical chronology.\n",

      " CERTAIN FLAWS WITH MODERN SCHOLARSHIP:\n",
      " \n",
      "I wish to point out something about modern scholarship that I think we should be aware of. Research has been carried out in France by a certain Christian Robin and André Lemaire on the subject of the \n",
      "Queen of Sheba and King Solomon.\n",
      " \n",
      "André Lemaire wrote: “The hypothesis of a Sheba in Northern Arabia at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE (Noth 1968: 223-224; Würthwein 1977: 121; Eph‘al 21984: 88-89, 227-229; Garbini 1984; Sarkiö 1994:190; Mulder 1998: 509-510) has no basis and is generally abandoned (Robin 1992: col. 1109-1110, 1118; Avanzini 1996: 13; Kitchen 1997b: 128.”\n",
      " \n",
      "He also writes: “The first mention of Sheba in Neo-Assyrian texts is to be dated mid-8th c. BCE with the story of a caravan of 200 camels coming from Tayma and Sheba to Hindanu (Middle-Euphrates) (Cavigneaux – Ismaïl 1990: 339-357; Frame 1995: 300; Younger 2003: 279-282; Holladay 2006: 319-321).”\n",
      " \n",
      "Contrary to modern scholarship, it should be noted here that, in Jewish tradition, king Solomon did not begin his reign in circa 1,000 BCE, as purported by modern scholarship, but rather in circa 843 BCE, as we find in Jewish tradition. Likewise, in Jewish tradition, the first Temple was destroyed in 422 BCE, rather than in the erroneous date used by scholars of the western world to fix its destruction, i.e. in 586 BCE. Modern scholars totally ignore Jewish tradition and wrongly put historical events at least 200 years earlier, which accounts for the discrepancies in calibrating these important events and not finding historical records to substantiate these events.\n",
      " \n",
      "The one major flaw in their critical view of Jewish texts is the belief that if they cannot find an archaeological document affirming a certain event mentioned in the Bible, for them it is as though the event never happened. This is a fallacy in logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin to tackle this tremendous difficulty with modern scholarship and Jewish tradition, we must first lay down a premise that will follow us all throughout this discussion, and that is the fact that historical records have been kept by Jews since ancient times, and they have often preserved these very written accounts of events by marking their dates in the Seleucid Era counting. This is vital, as without which information, it will be virtually impossible to determine the sequence of events and to correctly compare them with dates in the Julian / Gregorian calendars. \n",

      "The Aramaic \"\"Scroll of Antiochus,\"\" known in Hebrew as \"\"Megillath Benei Hašmonai\"\" (The Scroll of the Sons of Asamoneus), is a curious document, alleged by Rabbi Saadia Gaon in his Introduction to \"\"Ha-Eggron\"\" to have been written by the elders of the schools of Hillel and Shammai in the Chaldaic language, meaning, a document that dates back earlier than the book Seder Olam, composed by Rabbi Yose b. Halpetha in the 2nd century CE. In that book, the \"\"Scroll of Antiochus,\"\" we find this remarkable remark, viz., that \"\"from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total.\"\"\n",

There's a similarity in geography and landscape with Arizona and Nevada for those living in the Indio area. Culturally, the high Latino/Hispanic element might have to do with the name change, as some in Imperial county might refer to \"\"American Mexico/ Mex-USA\"\". Indio and Coachella became one of the U.S./Cal. highest concentrates of Hispanic or Mexican Americans, since immigration was very high for the two towns in the 1990s. I been to Imperial County, there's still plenty of farmland and the towns are growing within the confines of city limits. It's going to change and with NAFTA passed in 1993, the border city of Calexico seem to boom and thrive the most. Mexicali is a major city, the capital of Baja Cal. Mexico and perhaps the closest major city from Indio than Riverside or San Diego. The regional term seems to follow where white Anglos are the majority, but the eastward move of more (no pun intended) to Indio-Coachella to purchase a new home or property in bargain prices, the pendulum may be shifting back.

      "\":LOL, gee, I wish you were part of WP:Canada.  I've tried to raise the issue of their irrelevance before but got shot down, rather patronizingly too.  They're supposed to be parallel to \"\"People from Whatcom County\"\" or \"\"People from Oxfordshire\"\" but the reality is that regional districts are not anything like counties are, especially not in terms of any self-referential \"\"this is where I'm from sense\"\".  Unless you mean all \"\"people from XXX\"\" categories....in the case of regional districts, which have only existed since 1867-1968 and also do not include Indian Reserves in their governance, and have extremely limited powers (sewer, zoning, some planning and disaster management), they're not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with Indian Reserves or people from them; some users, like User:Backspace, and I, got into something like edit wars over his/her labelling objects like mountains, lakes, etc with them, and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way (different branch of the governance system, namely Ministry of Environment); there's also, y'see, Forest Districts and Forest Regions, Land Districts (which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind), Ministry of Environment Regions (for parks theoretically but BC Parks, has its own system within MoE), Health Regions (hospitals, etc), School Districts, \"\"Counties\"\" (which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life), Development Regions (which ARE relevant to daily life and provincially-kept statistics, though tey're formed from aglloomerations/boundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively), and BC Tourism (http://www.hellobc.com) has its OWN system of regions.  The rationale provided by the regional district categories-defenders is that because it's the system that StatsCan uses to divvy up BC for the census, i.e. counting people, then it \"\"makes sense\"\" to use them as geographic subdivisions for \"\"where people are from\"\".  But it just doesn't make sense....the problem now is that there's all kinds of mirrored wiki-clones which ahve statments like \"\"XXX Mountain is a mountain in the such-and-so regional district\"\", though the more relevant reference is \"\"in the such-and-so mountain range\"\" or \"\"in the xxx Country/Valley\"\" (in BC there's lots of historical region-references of the \"\"Nicola Country\"\", \"\"Shuswap Country\"\", \"\"Omineca Country\"\" type, sometimes capitalized, though often not, and often just \"\"the Shuswap\"\", \"\"the Okanagan\"\", \"\"the Omineca\"\" etc, and regional district names, and also electoral district names, are often \"\"built out of them\"\", e.g. Columbia-Shuswap, Okanagan-Similkameen; but I've also seen translated categories/articles saying \"\"Fraser Valley\"\" when meaning the Fraser Valley Regional District; the problem is that only half of the Fraser Valley is even IN the regional district of that name (the rest is in the Greater Vancouver one), and similarly the Cariboo Regional District doesn't include all of the Cariboo, and itself includes a region known as the Chilcotin.  I've created categories for most of those areas, and a parallel hierachy for same, but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries can't be cited easily; even though they're what people actually use and historically pre-date even the province itself.......there's some subcategories using that format e.g. Category:People from the Similkameen (where \"\"the Similkameen\"\" = \"\"the Similkameen Country\"\" and also Category:Cariboo people, although that's largely intended for historical figures from that region's glory days during the Cariboo Gold Rush and since.  In the way British Columbians actually talk, \"\"so-and-so is from the Thompson-Nicola Regional District\"\" would mean that that person WORKS for the Thompson-Nicola Regional District\"\", most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person.  Myself, I'd like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that; the rationale is that some other long-ago Wikipedian created the hierarchy \"\"and so we should respect that\"\", even though that person, to me, was utterly clueless and shouldn't have created them at all.  The only thing the main RD categories should be used for is the component municipalities; though there are some Electoral Areas that have articles; but ti's when those start getting used as geographic descriptors, it's entirely offbase; it's all over Googlemaps and Wikimaps, too, and it's really annoying to see; similarly the use of the French-form of Indian Reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hell's half digital acreage because it's what StatsCan (wrongly) uses.  As if StatsCan were the only'' classification system and as if real people talked like bureaucrats in Ottawa do....anyway sorry for the rant, it's been rare for me to find\n",

      "It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a \"\"Whatever gets you through the night\"\" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate. It is something that they love devoutly and use it to hate christians.\"\n",

Making this specific point only at the article on the Manchus sounds like a rationalisation or excuse. It sounds highly defensive, as though there is no real basis for asserting Manchu ethnic identity other than the over-subtle distinctions of academics. We know that Crossley argued from this point of view, but is it necessary to incorporate this in the article?

      "Ethnologue version 14 (valid from 2000 to 2005) contains different information from Ethnologue version 15 (from 2005 onwards). Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time \"\"mother tongue\"\" and \"\"most frequently used language\"\" were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the \"\"mother tongue\"\" question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about \"\"Orthodox Chams\"\"). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.\n",

Now, if there is no test of verifiability, it can make things impossible for other editors, as it may not be obvious, from looking at the article and history page, which editor is a genius, which one has a PhD in solar power generation, and which one has been getting their ideas from conspiracy rags and voices in their head. (Not to be harsh to the mentally ill - but you see that it's a problem.) To demand a level of expertise of editors would be to drastically restrict the effectiveness of Wikipedia, and cause endless arguments about who is best qualified. Using the principle of verifiability, however, makes it much easier to maintain reliable articles.\n",

One way is clarify the new definitions that certain Federal Visionists have created for certain established theological terms and phrases.

If that is your basis for the inclusion of a discussion of his father's activities it is pretty weak. Firstly, there is no wikilink that would resolve this addition like [Irgun]]. Secondly, its not a POV. In summation, the general scheme of COS's is not to include background information on the person's father, which makes the desperation of some editors to include POV edits in this article all the more perplexing. crewer (yada, yada) \n",

      " this morning I edited Derrick Bell's page and added a link from a NYT article that state that one of his famous essays, The Trade Spacers is considered antisemitic by many people.  A few hours later, the addition was deleted.  I posted it again, and noticed that another user did the following:  \n",

      "   I find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that Space Traders is considered an antisemitic essay, even though there was a link to the original article from NYT where it was discussed and prominent Professors like Dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work. There is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people's philosophy. The reason that people have started shunning Wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts. If someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that Bell left the deanship at Oregon Law School because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school, I could understand that. But there are articles about his antisemitism. Bell's page does not even include his racist comments about Clarence Thomas, \"\"The choice of Clarence Thomas replicates the slave masters' practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters' views.\"\" Also, Prioryman, name calling people you disagree with \"\"dunderheads\"\" really diminishes Wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots.\n",

I am a simple person, the type of people that Wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at Bell's page and here are what sours people with Wikipedia. Is not it bigoted behavior for Prioryman to call people that have opposing views \"\"dunderheads\"\"?

Or it may be because HJ lives in England where free speech is not allowed. As Americans, that's one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended. Free speech is what makes us different from Europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish, instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in Europe.  I am really surprised by this whole behavior. Is this high school, or what? We are all adults and we should engage in conversation, not call mom when we do not like something.

      "To Huon and Stephan2 ' At the present time I do not agree with either of your positions regarding the use of images on the Sergio Franchi biography. First of all are enough images.\"\" I do not believe that editors should be concerned with the absolute number of images. I do not believe that pictures which represent different aspects of a person's life are excessive. On the Filmography I used lots of images because Franchi was in a lot of TV productions. On the biography page, I am sure I could remove a few images, but our culture is image-driven and I used the images believing that their use would draw attention to this person's life. Dying before the advent of the internet his memory was almost allowed to die because none of his contemporaries carried his story onto the internet..thus my desire to preserve the biography of a person who was very important during the late 20th century in musical and theater history. As for my own motives as an editor of Wikipedia, I have used my work on these pages to increase my expertise as a Wikipedia editor, and have made contributions on every page that I felt competent to add at the time. This has also increased my editorial knowledge.  Enough about personal motivation. As to the issue at hand... Wikipedia's biography portal describes a biography as \"\"a detailed description of someone's life. More than a list of basic facts [education, relationships, and death)....a biography ...highlights various aspects of his or her life....\"\" THAT is why I believe that the non-free image depicting Franchi's beloved avocations were deserving of representation in the 2 photos showing his automobile and pewter collections. I also felt that a textual statement would be enhanced by the 2 photos that I had discovered. As to the Non-free book cover depicting Sergio Franchi's 18 months of his life on the Broadway stage musical \"\"Nine'..as you are aware, usually only the original creator of the role is given fair space. However, his role was considered import enough by the producers to warrant new posters, programs, and an original song...I believe that the visual reminder of his impact on musical theater in 1984 was important. There were no other free images available after 1976 when the copyright law regarding publicity photos. I am interested in improving as an editor, and if you still believe that I should remove the Library of Congress image (Pewter collection), I will comply with your suggestion. Please consider my argument on it's retention. Thanks  \n",

      "Thank you for your kind reply. Judging from the sources I have, I think the concept of spatial tense is only relevant in the context of the artificial language Lojban. The statement that several natural languages have spatial tense as defined in the article is still an unsubstantiated claim, so imho it should be pulled out pending evidence. Part of the problem is the very name of the concept. 'Tense' has the connotation of 'time'. In fact, grammatical tense is frequently (if loosely) defined as 'location in time'. Thus, it doesn't really make sense to talk about 'spatial tense'; it would be like talking about 'temporal place'.\n",
      "Since the only relevant use of the concept stems from Lojban grammar, I think it would be best to start the article out of the Lojban perspective, defining spatial tense as Lojban grammar defines it. And since spatial tense (according to Lojban grammar) is merely 'obligated expression of location', the broader context of the article should be the expression of space in language. And this is where observations about the connection between language and the way we perceive the world come in. The way I see it, the spatial cases of the Hopi language (one of the many languages that do very interesting things with space) don't really belong in an article about an invented, English-inspired, grammatical category. What we are really missing is a decent article about the way languages deal with location and space. Which is something I added to my to do list. —  (talk) 16:55, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)\n",

      "I have been to several Larouche meetings and I find it very interesting that the Larouche Movement advocates that we non-members are conditioned by fear (especially baby boomers) not to join their fight when on the contrary they use nothing but catastrophic speculations as recruitment. Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that’s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them ‘academic’. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it’s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie’s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.\n",

      "It's a good question. I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping.\n",

That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think. It'd be a big chunk of work to implement if links end up having to be added, although it's the kind of gnoming that's right up my alley, as you know. >)\n",

      "\"::Hi, I'll also post this on  page.  Firstly, Catgut, I welcome your comments and hope you always feel free to offer them.   I think that this list is always going to be subjective, and only open discussion is going to provide the best result.   I think Wildhartlivie makes a very valid point in addressing the limitations and \"\"key audience\"\" of this project, which is the English speaking world.   Going back to the definition/criteria for inclusion  Core topics about actors and filmmakers. \"\"Generally, these are people who are extremely notable to the common person. This category should stay limited to approximately 100 members\"\".  I think 100 is just an arbitrary number, and I think we should agree that it should be viewed as a guide rather than a rule.   The most important point is \"\"extremely notable to the common person\"\" and in this project the \"\"common\"\" person is someone who predominently speaks English, and it would follow that the interests and backgrounds of the great majority of these people would be related to the culture of English-speaking countries in whatever field they happen to be looking, whether it's music, literature or cinema.   I would expect that the average Chinese cinema-goer would be unfamiliar with almost every name on the current list, but if you were to go to Chinese Wikipedia you would rightly see that their articles are skewed with a Chinese perspective.   I don't think that adding names that are best known within their own non-English language industries would balance this list.   I think it would actually \"\"unbalance\"\" it by adding a number of names that are unfamiliar to the people who most often use these pages, and whose culture is supposed to be reflected in the ratings given.   Someone such as Sharukh Khan, to choose one name at random, is undeniably a significant figure but from the point of view of English language Wikipedia, and the English language experience of most of its readers, would have much less relevance.  I agree that this requires further discussion, and certainly individual names should be discussed, but I think to provide a completely balanced world-view would be beyond the scope of this project.  I would also like to echo another of Wildhartlivie's comments  one of the main results of tagging these articles should be that they are spotlighted by the community at large, as articles that merit elevation to good or featured standard.  It's saying \"\"these articles need to be fixed first\"\" rather than \"\"these individuals made more startling contributions to world cinema than anyone else\"\", although notability and influence are crucial to identifying the subjects.     \n",

But with a ban, he'd just be restricted from those category pages and others' userspace. He could edit and talk in the non-categorized (econ, etc.)  and revert obvious vandalism type stuff. Now will he agree to a voluntary ban? I doubt it. He has not reacted very positively to my proposal. Instead, \"\"you guys\"\" must comply with his conditions, e.g., stop me, Rubin & SPECIFICO from harassing him. And consider his latest example. He cites one thread that was civil, verses the 116 diffs that I complied. (I'd proposed the Editor review to him before, but he won't do it.)

X did 3 edits, 72Dino did 10, I did 9, Rubin, SPECIFICO, and the bot each did 1.) X asks if anyone objects to posting stuff, which can't be ignored because he'll take it as a green light for more lousy editing. Okay. I'll stop. Maybe I'll repost my .

Irvine22 has been confirmed as a puppetmaster for the purposes of block evasion, refused to acknowledge or apologize for the incident, and then began to implement a series of disruptive, POV edits without discussing the matter on the talk page.  His edits have been almost universally reverted, and yet he continues to make them, after being told many times by many editors as well as one admin to raise issues on the talk page first.  He shows no sign of ceasing this behaviour, nor will he acknowledge, much less address, any criticism of it.

Once an editor realizes that nothing he says will have any positive effect on the censors (or should I say, \"\"commissars\"\"?), he would be a fool to waste his time and energy trying to change that which cannot be changed.

What is, perhaps, the most effective attempt at a definition is that given by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), the controlling body of English Freemasonry:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"[Freemasonry is] one of the world's oldest secular fraternal societies... society of men concerned with spiritual values. Its members are taught its precepts by a series of ritual dramas, which folow ancient forms and use stonemasons' customs and tools as allegorical guides.

Membership is open to men of any race or religion who can fulfil this essential qualification and are of good repute.\"\"\n",

      "The traditional view of the origins of Freemasonry is that it descended in a direct line from a presumed governing body of operative stonemasons. There is, however, no firm evidence to support this view. In England, no organisation of operative or working masons survived The Reformation, and there are only a few instances of non-working masons being admitted to masonic lodges during the 17th century - probably with the aim of creating meeting places for those who sought to promote religious and political tolerance in an intolerant age. Honorary members were also admitted to operative masonic lodges in Scotland, but there is no evidence that such lodges employed ceremonies of initiation or engaged in philosophical discussion.\n",

      "Truly Speculative Masonry can be certainly dated only to 1717, when four lodges in London united to form a Grand Lodge as a governing body of English Freemasonry. The number of lodges under the premier Grand Lodge increased rapidly, and by 1723 their rules and regulations had been codified in the first publication of the constitutions.\"\"\n",

      "In the Middle Ages, law students studied rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, as an essential technique of their profession. In the Renaissance, however, beginning with Petrarch (c. 1310-1380) there was a movement to focus on the philosophical purpose of persuasion, which was to lead men to wisdom (virtue). The humanists looked to Cicero and other Latin authors as their guides, both stylistic and philosophical. Teachers of rhetoric, called dictatores, began also to write treatises on government. They also called into question more traditional Medieval educational programs, which had become a very theoretical and technical study devoted to the fine points of Aristotelean logic and syllogisms, and which featured incorrect and sloppy Latin.\n",

The virtues essential for the citizens and leaders of a well ordered commonwealth comprise: Prudence, Fortitude (courage), Temperance, and Justice (to which Magnanimity, a Stoic, or Senecan virtue, was sometimes added). See Skinner, p. 96. The Heavenly virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity were above, but did not supersede these. Rather they completed them. In the Renaissance it was thought that virtue rather than birth constituted true nobility.\n",

Comparing the style of one textual copy to another of the same work, for example, they could detect inconsistencies and error. Comparing texts of different authors, they learned to identify different styles and periods. The continued use of this form of analysis eventually (very slowly) led to a new way of viewing history as embodying to continuous change and development, of  languages, works of art and literature, as well as of institution. This kind of thinking gradually undermined the former view of humanity and its works as uniform and unchanging.

      " On April 21, 1659, after a morning prayer, Trubetskoy ordered an all-out assault on the fortress's fortifications. The city was shelled, a few incendiary bombs were dropped inside, and the huge army moved on to capture the city. At one point the troops of Trubetskoy even broke inside the city walls, but were thrown back by the fierce resistance of the Cossacks inside. After the fiasco of the initial assault, Trubetskoy abandoned his plans of a quick assault and proceeded to shell the city and to fill the moat with earth. The Cossacks stubbornly held on in spite of all the fire unleashed on the city: during the night the earth put to fill in the moat was used to strengthen the city walls, and the besieged even undertook several daring counterattacks on Trubetskoy's besieging army. These attacks forced Prince Trubetskoy to move his military camp 10 km away from the city and thereby split his forces between the main army at his HQ and the army besieging Konotop. It is estimated that in the siege alone the Trubetskoy forces suffered casualties up to 10,000 men.[4] Instead of a quick campaign the siege dragged on for 70 days and gave Vyhovsky the much-needed time to prepare for the battle with the Russian army. Please clean away this exaggerated and long tale about nothing. You must add information, that Trubetskoy negotiated with Gulyanitski and finally had to put siege.

Never again was the tsar of Moscow able to master an army that strong. In mourning clothes showed himself Alexei Mikhailovich to the people and the terror seized Moscow. The blow was so hard because it was unexpected, and it followed such illustrious successes! It was only recently that Dolgoruki brought to Moscow a captured Lithuanian hetman, only recently was everyone talking about successes of Khovansky — and now Trubetskoy, for whom everyone had hopes higher than for others, and who was \"\"a man devout and graceful, in military affairs skilled and a fright for a foe\"\" — has ruined such a huge army! After capture of so many towns, after capture of the Lithuanian capital the royal city trembled for its own security: in August by tsar's decree people of all ranks hurried to build fortifications around Moscow. Often the tsar and the boyars were present themselves during the construction; people from outlying areas, their families with meagre belongings filled Moscow, and a rumour spread that the tsar was leaving to beyond the Volga and Yaroslavl[1].

      "This is the earliest known usage of \"\"myth\"\" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English \"\"fabulous\"\" doesn't mean \"\"wonderfully aesthetic\"\", it is the adjectival form of \"\"fable\"\", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term \"\"myth\"\" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things \"\"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history.\"\".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define \"\"myth\"\" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.

The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.

This is because the term \"\"mythology\"\" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from \"\"mythology\"\", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as \"\"mythology\"\".  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran \"\"mythology\"\" either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today \"\"mythology\"\".    (ውይይት) \n",

      "Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as \"\"mythology\"\" for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of \"\"mythology\"\" for these.

      "I just mentioned the social conflict, because the contemporary crisis of Judaism was less a conflict between Orthodox and Reform movement, but a social gap between a ruling minority, consisting of families which had bound together religious authorities, academics and wealthy merchants through marriages, and a ruled majority in the Jewish communities and town ghettos whose poverty had dramatically increased. This is not only the social context of the conflicts between Maskilim and Orthodox Rabbis or Maskilim and Reform Rabbis, but also between Orthodox authorities and mystic movements like Hasidism. Hasidim in Galicia and Bukovina usually understood much better the problems of the poor population than any Maskilim among the West Yiddish Ashkenazim in Alsace or Western regions of Prussia. And Polish nationalists and among them, Polish Jews who lived in the larger Shtetl and visited the universities in Wilna, Warsaw, Cracow and Lemberg, formed a governing elite in the Sejm of Lemberg – the parlament of the crownland Galicia. The rural communities of Galicia was another “uncivilized” world for modern Jews in Vienna, Paris, Budapest, Prague and Berlin.

      " Moses Mendelssohn certainly belonged to the privileged minority of the Schutzjuden and his circle was the upper class of Prussia, but this does not mean that they were not disappointed about the backwards conditions in Prussia, whatever faith they had. Wealthy members like the brothers Humboldt or Polish aristocrats were very engaged to improve the social conditions. They founded universities, hospitals, they improved the working conditions of coal miners etc. If I compare them with wealthy people today in Germany, I can assure that they were much less ignorant. Otherwise they were also very intolerant people (especially around Fichte in Jena) like the demagogues who cause the hep hep progroms, so Hegel and his pupils had to go the ghetto to protect their inhabitants...\n",
      "\n",
      " But like David Friedländer Moses Mendelssohn’s social sphere had an impact on his concept of modern Judaism. As a pedagogue he wanted to teach Jewish children German, Hebrew and Greek, but he refused Yiddish as a corrupt dialect, which finally meant to refuse the prospering culture (literature and drama) of East Yiddish and the Ashkenazim world from Wilna to Bucarest. From the point of view of Alsatian Ashkenazim, Mendelssohn was admired as a radical philosopher of Haskalah, but the reason behind his radical attitude was the extreme pressure of assimilation, that the Jewish population had to suffer in Prussia. For this reason I was a little bit surprised about your categorization of Moses Mendelssohn as an Orthodox Jew. Conversion finally remained the main access into the ruling elite of Prussia which can be easily analyzed by the cynical statements of Heinrich Heine (especially his commentaries of the Pietist circles around the children and grandchildren: “He [Felix] is the grandson of the great philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, but he has nothing better to do than to set the lamb’s piss into music!”).\n",

I am reading the article on Hessen-Darmstadt (redirects to it) and it says \"\"In 1871, it became a constituent state of the German Empire.\"\" So that's not sovereign anymore, anything before that until 1806 maybe, but not after the founding of the German Empire, all state monarchies lost their sovereignty. Here is also a list of all the states Category:States of the Holy Roman Empire. IMO they only had sovereignty between the end of the Holy Roman Empire from 1806 until the foundation of the Second Reich in 1871.

I imagine that most of the descriptions of technology will be like this (not yet applicable to humans but could be in the future), other than that which applies to human cells in culture.\n",

It is valid under a broader definition where \"\"evolution\"\" simply means \"\"change over time,\"\" but it implies some mechanism of progress or goal-directedness (\"\"stages\"\") - so it is somewhat misleading when applied to biological evolution, which doesn't have these properties. \n",

But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with \"\"Vost\"\", \"\"ElliotJoyce\"\", or \"\"Accreditor\"\", and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started.

Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me.

      "I disagree with the analysis of John Z. Remember, in 1967 Israel agreed to UN Resolution 242 while Arab states rejected it... I think it is futile to draw conclusions about the outcome of the war based on what different leaders of Egypt and Israel agreed to at different times, if only because these decisions have as much to do with domestic and global situations as with the bi-lateral and regional conflict itself. In case of Sadat's peace initiative, the Israeli postion was also largely determined by the style in which it was presented. But, again, I agree with you completely that one-word interpretations have no place in the infobox or lead, and arguably, in the article. Instead, arguments from different sources and on different aspects need to be all presented and contrasted. No conclusion is warranted.  \n",
      " That simply isn't true about SC 242, though it is a common misapprehension.  See our article (or more comprehensible, less battleground-like old versions). Egypt and Jordan immediately accepted SC 242, while Israel neither accepted nor rejected it. During 1968 it at first privately to the UN Secretary General, and later publicly, gradually accepted SC242. A clear Israeli public acceptance including the word \"\"withdrawal\"\" was not made until August 1970 as part of the Israeli-Egyptian-Jordanian acceptance of the Rogers B plan; it was controversial enough to induce Begin to resign from the cabinet.

Next off, I'm not egotistical so showing off my editing skills is a non-issue, plus this is Wikipedia, someone else editing your work is a fact of life. Third, Deja Vu Artworks is based in Japan, if I worked for them that would seem that I lived in Japan as well, in which case, why would I want to Americanize the article?  Which brings us to trying to improve the article. As noted before, a good chuck of infomraiton in the original revisions was irrelevant - you do NOT need a song listing from a flash animation in an article that is a general overview of a subject. Also, the Deja Vu information was removed because it was unsourced and I can't seem to find any indication of resolution for the topic - it happened in 2004 and it is now 2007 either it was resolved or it fell by the way side, where as the Netrunner controversy is still on going and received a great deal of notice when it happened. If there is a bunch of information on Deja Vu that I am missing then by all means, point out some links and we can work it into the article. Now, in regards to most of the changes - this article toes very close to the fancruft category and as such most of the edits are there to try and pull it away from that category.

Now all that said, there is no reason why the descriptions of the top five 'tans can be expanded a bit, but you must remember that should not be a full bio of the characters, plus the fact that they can be changed at an artists whim means that you can't write in the matter of \"\"OSX-tan is always seen poking XP-tan\"\" with a stick - that is just one thing that an artist can do.  \"\n",

However if evolution is accepted as fact, then teleological arguments on the origin of religion cannot be considered scientific, in which case the evolutionary theories on the origin of religion and \"\"origin of religion\"\" are the same.   \n",
      "First of all I have told you a thousand times already that actual evolutionary theories on the origin of religion are like those of Boyer, Wolpert and Dawkins and they are miles away from what you have been writing about.  Also the logic you present above is simply not correct at all.  The fact that human physiology is a product of biological evolution does not mean that the origin of religion can be explained through evolutionary mechanisms or as a product of biological evolution.  Perhaps without the evolution of certain cognitive capacities human practices like religion would not be possible, but the origin of religion itself may be entirely \"\"social\"\" or \"\"cultural\"\" given a certain state of cognitive evolution.  If that were the case then theories of religion's origin would not be evolutionary theories at all, yet they would be equally \"\"scientific\"\" and clearly non-religious in nature.  That is to say biological evolution itself is not necessarily causal of religion, even if it may be necessary to create a certain precondition (e.g. a capacity for symbolic thought) for religious belief.  \n",

      "We have a content dispute that is mainly between myself and you. Dbachmann occasionaly gets involved switching between sides. But essentially this is between me and you. This is why we are not making progress, because we do not have any editors who are willing to dedicate the time and effort to work on this this. Consequently you are taking advantage of this lack of editors and you are using an old AFD as your leverage, because you can run to any admin, who only know the rules and know little about content. This is unfair and unacademic and is very political. Dbachmann knows very well that the articles I created are valid. He has admitted that he agrees in principal with the ideas I have presented, but simply disagrees with me because he dislikes my demeanor User_talk:Dbachmann#origin_of_religion. I had worked on the article \"\"Origin of language\"\" using the same approach. Before I started working on the origin of language, the topic was approached from a psychological or sociological perspective filled with archaic fringe and opinionated theories. I proceeded to add the evolutionary perspective to the article, after which Dbachmann reviewed the article with some refactoring he upgraded the article to B-class. I used the same approach on the origin of religion only to be met with some of the worst hostility to knowledge. As I often mention, you had even disputed the out of Africa hypothesis, or that grave goods are considered evidence of a belief in the afterlife . Here you are seen to be making up your own theories. So I do feel justified to doubt the credibility of some of your assertions and also some of the other editors. I have always asked admins and a lot of other editors to assist in dispute resolution, but many seem content with pushing buttons and chasing after vandals and boosting their egos by blocking people, they have no interest in content. So I propose to go for dispute resolution, if you think you have a case, you should opt for it. If you are afraid and want to continue using the archaic AFD as your silver bullet, then this dispute will needlessly continue. Of course the result will be blocks of which I am the top candidate, but what a waste that would be. Who would be there to provide education on grave goods.   \n",

      "MarnetteD clearly has a watch list longer than my arm given his response time to reverting things, so he'll see what's been done and will just have to deal with it. While categories may require reliable sourcing, to a degree, the fact remains than for so many actors dating back to the 50s, 60s, 70s, especially, there is unlikely to be centralised sourcing, though many books are in print, such as actor biogs, few editors are really going to dig them all out and cite hundreds of actors entire career for each TV and film appearance, it would take months, even years, of effort. Wikipedia:Citing IMDb notes that IMDB has been a constant source of dispute over its reliability. However, for a category to simply state \"\"this person was a Western (genre) TV actor\"\" hardly requires AAA-rated reliable sourcing, and I do believe than IMDB meets the requirements as a tertiary source, confirming the fact that all those actors were active in that genre. Many of the individual articles for each Western TV series don't contain any more sourcing than IMDB, so it is not wrong to identify MarnetteD's reverts as \"\"missing the point\"\" when it comes to avoiding WP:POINTed behaviour. A tertiary source is better than no source at all, and categories are hardly top-level articles worth war-editing over. I find his behaviour protracted, bullyish and contrived as well as completely lacking WP:AGF standards. He needs to holster his attitude, because I'm not afraid to present his behaviour, including repeated history of the same behaviour, to ANI/EW and request that action be taken for his abuse of policy and anti-IP sniping motions. The lack of maturity exhibited in reverting those articles without consensus, openly taking advantage of my 48 hour block, will not be seen in good taste as it was clearly an opportunistic move, but a very stupid one which I don't take lightly. WP:BURO and WP:IAR applies here. We don't need strict reliable sourcing for a category as all those actors have an IMDB page, the majority of those IMDB pages are accurate, and if the category aims to improve wiki by indexing all the actors of that genre, it is for the better. To filter out those which lack a reliable source lacks NPOV because there are dozens of categories which make statements about things and people which don't have strong sourcing. But in this case, knowing an actor was a Western TV actor is hardly controversial. If MarnetteD reverts a single page he should be prepared to back it up with something other than WP:DEFINING, which is a guideline, not policy, but so far as \"\"if the characteristic would not be appropriate to mention in the lead portion of an article, it is probably not defining\"\" goes, there are considerably more articles that don't follow that ideal to the letter than do, which makes it a weak guideline to attempt to enforce unless an editor has a strong motive to do so. If he enjoys attention and drama, I expect to see him an ANI/EW before the week's out. 82.8.252.13  \"\n",

      "No doubt footnote no.1 correctly ascribes the information on the map to the WHO but clearly the WHO is not the appropriate authority given that the UN as we all know deals with countries' self-reporting. May I point out that Malaysia and Indonesia, which are described as Muslim countries (as they officially indeed are), contain very substantial Christian, Buddhist and Hindu minorities. (See the CIA World Fact Book .) Moreover, many such minorities are considerably to be identified by region. North Borneo and New Guinea, for example, are very large geographical areas in Malaysia and Indonesia which only have a marginal Muslim presence; the Moluccas in Indonesia are at least 50% Christian; Bali is famously Hindu. Overall, Malaysia is some 60% Muslim and clearly does not belong in the plus-80% circumcised category as it appears on the map. But given the geographical spread of these countries and vast disparity of cultures and religions across the Indonesian Archipelago, it is surely meaningless to describe these countries in such a way. One is reminded of the generalisation in a former version of this article as to aboriginal Australians based, it seems, on certain academic studies of remote communities which did not at all constitute a valid observation as to aboriginal Australians as a whole.\n",

It makes claims of possible malpractice that, if true, should be taken up in court, not fought out here on WP.  Also, I disagree with simply repasting the conflict of interest, advertising and other tags.  The puffery and peacock words are gone.  I took them out myself.  I have no connection with Ousterhout.  I haven't even talked to him or anyone on his staff in perhaps 10 years.  Finally, I disagree with removing the sentence describing what he does; the patient accounts make it clear both what he does and that he often does it in a single day of surgery.  I do concede it's worth citing his book in support of the statement that he developed the procedures in the 1990s.\n",

The production of such lists, and the tagging, could be automated, and all you'd really need is people to weed out the false positives.

Both seem to mirror the author’s perception of The City, that “Life in New York always seemed to be moving back and forth, up and down - up and down, back and forth like violin notes; notes that are impressively changing and always dramatic.” Perhaps what is most memorable about this story are the thoughts Norcross poses and then ponders. And there are myriad statements that gave me pause when I read them; some because they are concise gems, others because they document simple gestures that hint of epic proportion when I tilted my perception ever so slightly. While The Violin Diary, on the surface, is a compilation of memories, it is really about one’s heart: where it starts, where it ends, and everything in between.

The most infamous ship is that of the 'Zutara' ship. As the portmanteau  name implies, the ship involves the characters Zuko and Katara, and was first catalyzed by Zuko tying Katara to a try and attempting to bribe her with the necklace of her deceased mother in 'The Waterbending Scroll'. One way or another, it has grown to be one of the most recognizable ship, and also helping it was the fact that the two voice actors shared a parallel relationship on another show, 'American Dragon Jake Long'. Regardless of it origins, due to being known to regularly visits their fansites and forums, the creators are quite aware of the ship or at least seem to enjoy playing with it, as it has been mentioned in almost every interview/convention.

Papen was bent on authoritarian rule and, since in the Reichstag only the conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) supported his administration, he immediately called for new elections in July.

Hitler, however, would settle for nothing less than the chancellorship. He put further pressure on Papen by entertaining parallel negotiations with the Centre Party, Papen's former party, which was bent on bringing down the renegade Papen. In both negotiations, Hitler demanded that he, as leader of the strongest party, must be Chancellor, but Hindenburg consistently refused to appoint the \"\"Bohemian lance corporal\"\" to the chancellorship.\n",

If there were an article on the fictional abbey then it would properly be categorized as a fictional library, and an article on Blind Jorge would belong in the fictional librarians category. Do you understand the mess that would result if real things were categorized on the basis of all of the fictional things withiin them? The typical book or film article could potentially be in dozens of \"\"fictional foos\"\" categories, which would swamp the categories for what the book or film actually is and would render the fictional items categories useless.

If we simply used the \"\"Black\"\" figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the \"\"Brown\"\" figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the \"\"black\"\"/\"\"brown\"\" colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. \n",
      "The 100% issue is a red herring - \"\"mestizo\"\" and \"\"African ancestry\"\" are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... \"\"mestizo\"\" in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in \"\"mestizo\"\" are also included in \"\"African ancestry\"\" and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect \"\"Afican ancestry\"\" to be all of the \"\"Black\"\" category plus part of the \"\"Brown\"\" category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternative theoretical formulations: Alternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics as opposed to dark matter, are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, the theory of continental drift had quite a lot of evidence, but was heavily criticised because there was no known mechanism for continents to move, and thus such evidence was dismissed. When such a mechanism was discovered, it became mainstream as plate tectonics.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine whether something falls into the category of pseudoscience or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence which it is difficult to explain away, in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in basic scientific laws or reality in order to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies mainly on weak evidence, such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence at just above the level of detection, though it may have a few papers with positive results, for example: parapsychology and homeopathy.\n",

That is what happens both in the UK (where the power to appoint the government rests with the Queen)  and in the France (where it is the President of the Republic who appoints the Council of Ministers). In Germany, the Federal President also appoints all other federal ministers on the recommendation of the chancellor, but the chancellor him/herself is actually elected by the Bundestag, thus making Germany fall into your proposed \"\"direct parliamentarism\"\" category instead.\n",

      "Hello, I see you are a custodian, saw your message on the fair use issue. I am in the middle of negotiating with a photographer for a free license on an image posted previously as a fair use item. He wants it to be in Wikipedia but there is a language barrier and he needs help understanding what his choices are. I am worried am going to explain it poorly to him. He is from Switzerland and asked me to keep it simple and short how I explain it, not send him a link to a legal manual. Can you help me? I am conversing with him via email. I do not want to post his email address publicly here unless I get his approval. If you want to talk to me in email about this, my email address works in my box here. It is about an image Chowbok tagged and an additional one as well so I don't want to delay explaining the licenses to this person. I don't want him to be confused. He is a professional. I want him to understand well enough that he even opts not to license it if it is not best for him. We could try to get something else if it is not the right thing for him. But I think he would like to do this if we can just help him understand. What protects his photo credit best? GFDL? CC BY SA? Also, the GFDL mentions in the text that someone copying 100 copies or more must be given the source code, which is meaning a software package. For a photo, I hope the \"\"source code\"\" would not be any greater image than what he gives us to put in Wikipedia. He may even decide to give us a bigger image than what we have up currently. I am in the middle of trying to answer this photographer and am worried I'm going to write something he won't understand or that's too long. –  \"\n",

      "OK , I think I understand what you are intending. As it stands your new category won't last very long as it is not nested into an appropriate higher level category. All categories sit in a nested structure which , if followed upwards, will always end with [[Category:Main topic classifications]] (I have surrounded this category with nowiki tags to avoid this discussion being categorised). To create an appropriate category, the simplest way is to go to the best relevant higher level category such as Category:American Singers and then works downwards through that until you reach a level where individual singers are listed. That is probably the place to create your new category. I can't promise that even then it will stick - that is up to the views of other editors. Hope that this helps. Regards    Velella Talk   \"\n",

Given that I do think it belongs in Wikipedia, and suggest merging and redirecting it with a new article on other similarly-themed D&D; modules. This would have the advantage of 1) allying yourself with other editors with articles in this category, and 2) being able to gather all the secondary sources in one place to address notability concerns. I was thinking about this last night and had the idea that it could fit with 3rd edition modules with a generic setting. That would be a pretty good list of modules; take a look at List of Dungeons & Dragons adventures, and we should be able to gather a good number of secondary sources.

      "- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\n",

They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. \n",

But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant.

      "In this case, I guess I'm not sure about your proposal.  The templates certainly look good, so there's no issue there, but I'm weighing the pros and cons of another set of navigation boxes.  I think there are instances on Wikipedia where proper use of categories and list pages are probably sufficient to navigate a topic, and other places where navigation boxes really are desired.  For example, many athlete pages have an excessive use of navigation boxes, in my opinion.  Take a look at Toni Sailer, for example.  At least those five navigation boxes now utilize the show/hide feature - that page was very cluttered before.  Even so, I'm not sure that it is a natural way for readers to want to navigate through Wikipedia.  Do we really need a navigation box to go from one winner in a specific event at the world championships to the next?  Wouldn't it be just as easy to have a \"\"See also\"\" section with links to List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing and List of Alpine Skiing World Champions and navigate from there?\n",

      "It's not exactly a parallel situation, but perhaps the concept is similar  the question to be answered is do we really need this new set of navigation boxes (which will number around 350-400 if we make them for all events) or are a set of categories and the existing medalist lists sufficient?  I currently don't have a solid opinion on this myself, so I haven't offered one in response to your request on the WikiProject page.  However, if you have a logical position to support whichever path you take, and can lay the foundation for a consistent implementation across all events (not just diving), then I would support you either way.  Consistency is my biggest concern here.  Hope this helps,  \"\n",

      "By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  \n",
      "Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.\n",
      "On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.\n",
      "So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her \"\"clean up\"\" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.\n",
      "Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.\n",

      "\"This lowly editor thinks not. There is a perennial dispute on the table here. Egoistic vs. Non-Egoistic concerns, viz. Self vs. Non-Self concerns. Individual v. Social concerns. Libertarianism is a celebration of the ego isn't it? And by \"\"ego\"\" I mean self. From the self comes liberty. From the ego comes identity, etcetera etcetera. Socialism? That seems to me to be all about the NON-EGO. Freedom itself is derived from man. I know we're just a lowly democratic encyclopedia, and are prohibited from doing Original Research, but seriously guys, WAKE UP. Are Libertarians socialists? Isn't that like, the diametric opposite of libertarianism? I, for one, am not a big fan of submitting to the needs of the state or \"\"the people\"\". From socialism, I see, comes anarchism, viz. the propagation of herding behavior amongst humans. Viz., the abdication of a centralized authority. If there is no centralized authority, who controls the state of things? A dictator, that's who. Take North Korea for example. Or the former USSR, or Nazi Germany. All of these states are self-proclaimed socialists. Are libertarians socialists? I think not (Thomas Jefferson). Again, guys/girls, I'm just making an appeal to LOGIC, not AUTHORITY. This particular Wikipedia article rides a fence. Thoughts? Please do not remove this writing. I will re-establish it. I am simply trying to create a dialogue. Does libertarianism have ANYTHING to do with socialism? Because socialism, it seems, begs for anarchy-and anarchy, as it were, is a pre-requisite for dictatorship. Libertarians are the opposite of dictators, we are individuals...socialists are non-individuals, ideologically speaking. There is a tremendous amount of confusion, and out of this confusion comes intrepid leaders. I am an \"\"Anarch\"\", but I do not believe in Anarchy. Does that make any sense? If the majority disagrees with me, so be it. But do not delete this post. I would like to hear some thoughts. Carol, don't even think about it. Are we advocates of logic/truth or opinion?  \n",

Concepts of irony differ between concepts of ironic (most users of British English and Hiberno-English claim that Americans don't do irony - which was why some modern US comedy shows have shocked Europeans by showing that some members do indeed do irony.) Hiberno-English, which I speak and write, is heavily ironic and tongue-in-cheek. That comment was intended in that way. I understand Ed's desire for uniformity and indeed share it. I have been creating formats and styles since I came here. My only point is that when someone finds a better way of doing things we shouldn't adopt a mantra of 'Against the rules. Against the rules' but be willing to say 'that's a better way. Lets see how we can turn it from a once-off into something with a wider usage'. Maybe we should allow a number of variations on the master template, and so allow users to opt for one. Or create a specific template for religious leaders (say Gerald's one), and allow variations for other categories. I'm sorry if my sarcasm was mis-interpreted.

I rather think posting those links in commercial and personal spaces are acceptable and based on the rules of Wikipedia are not out of line. If posting them on all sub-links of Savannah as points of interest is wrong, I am sorry, but it seemed pertinent to me, especially since there is hardly any other information on those pages. I did not “spam” (as you say) any links on pages that were not somehow directly related to the subject of the links. Why you chose to pick those two links, out of many commercial and non-commercial links on the pages to dispute, I have no idea. I am sorry if you have a problem with ghost books but this one is directly related to Savannah, Georgia so it seems to me that this link would be the last one you would erase off the Savannah page. Having reviewed the “spamming” page link it seems to me that spamming would be on a much larger scale that the links I posted. If you would like I can move all of them to the bottom, if this appeases your mind. I also linked them in the external links section, this is not like I cut into every paragraph of the articles and inserted the link. I actually thought it might be of interest to people who happen to enjoy ghosts. I am not even in the employ of Cobblestone Tours or even James Caskey himself, I just thought (as a local Savannah resident who has read the book, taken the tour, and is a fan) that I should point more people who are interested in this sort of thing to the stories and experience. However, feel free to remove links that are not pertinent, if you so choose, but articles related directly to Savannah’s ghosts, I feel, are not in that category.  In the future though, if you would like to continue this discussion, feel free to send me an e-mail, this information should be available to you as I filled it out when I registered.\n",

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the 'Aftermath' section, it is noted:  In losses of aircraft and experienced aircrew, the battle was a blow from which the Luftwaffe never fully recovered. It had significantly fewer bombers at the start of Operation Barbarossa, some 929 machines, because of losses sustained over Britain.Bergström 2007, p. 129.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure if that is what Bergström, who is being referenced here, actually writes, as I do not have access to his books. I doubt it, however. The Luftwaffe frontline strenght certainly did not decrease as a result of the Battle of Britain, as reinforcements and production was more than sufficient to replace losses, and, to replace the existing types with more modern type of aircraft, withdrawing the older models (ie. by the start of Barbarossa, much of the 109E fleet was now replaced by the new 109F).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also contestable on grounds of Luftwaffe reported strenghts. Olaf Groehler, in 1975, for example reports the LW frontline strenght (not including a lot of aux. and non-combat oriented units) gives the LW strenght as 5298 on 11 April 1940 (before the Western Campaigns), of which 1356 were S-E fighters, 1711 being bombers and 414 being dive bombers. A day before Barbarossa, 21 June 1941, he reports 5599 aircraft, (ie. some 300 aircraft increase) including 1440 S-E fighters, another 263 in a new category, the night-fighters, 1511 bombers and 424 dive bombers. Therefore the claim that only 929 bombers were in the Luftwaffe (which I suspect is a misunderstanding of the original text) is wrong, as is the conclusion that this was due to some 'irreversible blow' suffered during the BoB. It may well be that 929 or so bombers were employed against Russia, while the others elsewhere in the West and in the Med. In any case, the claim that the BoB was some sort of a death blow to the LW lacks solid foundation. It certainly suffered considerable losses, as did the RAF which lost apprx. 100% of the fighter and bomber force it started the Battle with, but even in absolute terms those losses were not irrecoverable; the LW already lost about the same number of aircraft during the two months of the Battle of France as it did during the four months of the Battle of Britain; yet it was was capable of launching the BoB offensive just a month later, as it was capable of seizing complete air dominance over the Eastern front in 1941. Therefore I think that particular sentence is contenstable and should be removed.\n",

      "Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real \"\"edit conflict\"\" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - \"\"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references.\"\" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of \"\"Welsh nationality\"\" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his \"\"explanation\"\" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza8\n",
      "couldn't agree more! Sjo's 'method' appears to be that (sadly) typical mentality of deleting or reverting any new editor's referenced data in a manner which wholly contradicts Wiki policies, and especially against edits that actually conform to Wiki policies. Wikipedia is rapidly losing credibility as a Worldwide contribution site by having a select group of admins and editors who think they can act as judge, jury and God over anyone's edits that they might disagree with, whether or not it is a properly referenced and conform-to-policy.  The strap line about Wikipedia being a source that everyone can edit is becoming a pointless and hollow statement, when looking at the pattern of dictatorial and hypocritical editing policies applied by a core of prejudicial and arbitrary editors who seek to suppress any new input and then have the audacity to claim that the new editor is a troll. Sjo's arrogant reply to my question over whether  he should be reported for inconsistent application of Wiki policies sums it up. Editors like him are showing that Wikipedia and its concept of global participation is badly broken. Sad really, but there you go...

To get this figure, you probably included all organic content in the lithosphere, as if there was a remote chance to gzet anything usable from a 5 km deep shale with 1% of kerogen. You got confused \"\"light oil\"\", and \"\"conventionnal oil\"\". what you categorized as \"\"low-grade oil\"\" is, for a large part, not oil at all (kerogen). \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, there is a important notion you ignored  net energy yeld. The vast majority of low grade fossil \"\"fuels\"\", like deep oil shale, would consume more energy to extract than they would give. Already, the Athabasca oil sands have a self-consumption of about 30% - that could be reduced to some 25% with advanced technology. The small-sclae oil shale projects that were teste had a near-zero net energy yields - except in estonia, but the shales they used were among the richest known.\n",

      "Third, extraction rate is as important as reserves. Non conventionnal oil (biodegraded oil, bitumen, oil heavier than water...) is very difficult to take out. Kerogen from shale is even worst.

      "Fourth, non-conventionnal has an high environmental cost. CO2 emeissions on a full-cycle basis (from well to end use) are much higher. There are other problems like the destruction of ecosystems (for open-pit production of both oil shale of oil sands), water use (especially for oil shale), water pollution, disposal of wastes (for oil shales)... These environmental costs would become catastrophic is non-conventional production was to be upscaled to the same range of output than current conventional production.\"\n",

He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims and their actions, suggesting that a more accurate term would be \"\"Anti-Muslimism.\"\"[34] Poole responds by noting that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims.[35][36] Halliday also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis. Miles and Brown respond by arguing that \"\"the existence of different ‘Islamophobias’ does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism.\"\"[35] Halliday argues that the concept of Islamophobia unwittingly plays into the hands of extremists.[34]\n",
      "British writer and academic Kenan Malik believes that the charge of Islamophobia confuses discrimination against Muslims with criticism of Islam, and that it is used to silence critics and Muslim reformers. He writes that the extent to which Muslims are more vulnerable to social exclusion and attacks than other groups is frequently and allows for a culture of victimhood, where all failings are attributed to Islamophobia. Islamophobia is not a form of racism, in his view, because Islam is a belief system.[37] This analysis is criticized by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain and Abdul Wahid from the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.[38] Bunglawala writes that Malik's argument is limited to overt acts of violence against Muslims, without recognizing less overt forms of prejudice or discrimination. By ignoring non-violent examples of Islamophobia, Malik's commentary \"\"makes a mockery of victims of prejudice by pretending they have not been discriminated against,\"\" according to Bunglawala.[38]\n",

The novelist Salman Rushdie was among these signatories.[39] These views are shared by Dutch law professor Afshin Ellian.[40] Critics cite the case of British journalist Polly Toynbee, who was nominated in May 2003 for the title of \"\"Most Islamophobic Media Personality of the Year\"\" at the 'Annual Islamophobia Awards' overseen by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, for claiming that Islam \"\"... imposes harsh regimes that deny the most basic human rights.\"\"[41]\n",

      "In an article called \"\"Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics\"\", Assistant Professor Deepa Kumar writes that the modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that \"\"One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise.\"\" She also chides some \"\"people on the left\"\" for using the same \"\"Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime\"\". She concludes with the statement \"\"At times like this, people of conscience need to organize and speak out against Islamophobia.\"\"[42]\n",

That was also done after lengthy discussions during our last (and far more recent) MoS upgrade. And sorry, but as I'm actually and active member in TV, Film, and Anime and MoS I don't need to \"\"do research\"\" because I already know, however, let's actually look Category:Lists of television characters and Category:Lists of anime and manga characters and which one do you see as the naming convention used for the bulk of all lists? Let me make it easy: Television main cat has 167 lists, of which 48 use your preferred schema (and most of those are serious AfD bait), 19 follow neither convention with 13 being the Characters in/of variety of non-lists. Anime/Manga, 269 lists, only 13 of which do not use List of X characters, and of those only 4 use your preferred version, 1 uses Characters of, and the rest need renaming/merging/deleting.  Then there is the less populated Category:Lists of film characters with only 57 lists. Of those, again, 27 do not use List of X characters or are not actual lists. Of those 27, 3 use the Characters of/in, 1 uses X characters, and 23 use your preferred List of characters in/of X. So, vast majority of all of those use List of X characters, and most of those that don't aren't lists that their respective projects would even approve of their existance, and if kept as is, would be renamed. So, where is your research to actually show that yours is preferred, except by a single project which also rejects other guidelines. Where is the overall naming guideline that truly supports your claim without special interpretation? And where is your discussions giving consensus to begin renaming any such lists you feel doesn't meet this personal interpretation without any discussion.   (talk · contribs) \n",

At present the order of the day is containment while negotiations are carried out to secure a peaceful outcome.

Because fuel such as coal and wood were not readily available to inland cities, American settlers were forced to turn to other alternatives. Falling water was ideal for powering sawmills and grist mills.\n",

      "As coal became a better-developed source of fuel, however, the importance of hydropower decreased.

In the mid-20th century, as Americans began to move out of the cities and into \"\"suburbia,\"\" the demand for electricity increased, as did the role of hydroelectricity.

The program was designed to correct several problems in the Tennessee River Basin. These problems included frequent floods, erosion, and deforestation. The TVA provided for the building of several hydroelectric dams. Not only were the dams successful in controlling the flooding, they also provide electricity to the region. The TVA is an example of successful implementation of hydroelectric power.\n",

Even apart from the fact that you are generalising on several items: mode, temperature, duration of exposure, plus even more pertinent: on source of oil (what plant it is coming from, and which part of it) and whether it is a methyl ester or ethyl ester. In my view it is irresponsible to say categorically that biodiesel is non-toxic.

You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'.

Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.\n",

Literally TS/TG information is entirely intermingled, in some indeterminable amount.  The ambiguity of not collecting TS/TG information means that there is simply a blanket assumption about how the information is received from the CDC... the true answer is, because of the ambiguity no one knows how they're split up... the data is intermingled, and there is no way to separate the information.  Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked \"\"are you pregnant?\"\" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.  Without collecting gender identity information, no one can with certainty that all TS/TG are recorded as MSM.  The answer is \"\"it's inconsistent and no one knows\"\", not \"\"haha I'm right, you're wrong, TS/TG are always MSM\"\".   \"\n",

In the Myth of Male Power, he endorses the concept of a ‘gender transition movement‘ as an alternative to either a ‘women's movement‘ or ‘men's movement‘. He has maintained this position since the book's publication in 1993, and has continued to promote the notion in every book published since.

      "Warren Farrell (born 1943) is an American masculist author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farrell holds an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Political Science (UCLA; New York University (NYU)). He has taught at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and at Georgetown University, Rutgers, Brooklyn College, and American University.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the publication of The Myth of Male Power, Farrell became one of the first masculists. The term is difficult to precisely define, but in his case masculism is a form of celebrating men as no less than women, and rejecting any sexism displayed against men by women. Since the early 1970s, he has been a champion of feminism, serving on the board of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Within a few years, he was asked to leave NOW as his views diverged from those generally held in the organization; most specifically, he was critical of what he saw as female exclusiveness and disregard for men's issues. His early books The Liberated Man and Why Men Are the Way They Are were more in the vein of a type of men's liberation–an approach to men's issues similar to that of feminism to women's issues. These texts were not critical of feminism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farrell's critics declare him to be sexist and have an anti-woman attitude (or misogynistic). However, despite his being broadly attacked by many latter-day feminists including Susan Faludi.  In answering his critics, Farrell argues that his approach is essentially of equality and humanism. \n",
      "\n",
      "His approach to gender issues has come to be the cornerstone of masculism. His ideology calls for gender equivalence and, unlike some other masculists, a reduction in traditional gender roles. He has made a critical examination of the power imbalance between the sexes, claiming that in some cases it favors women: \"\"The women's movement had done a wonderful job of freeing women from sex roles, but no one did the same for men\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Farrell was a candidate for governor in the 2003 California recall election. He came ninety-seventh out of 135 candidates. \n",
      "\n",
      "On May 27, 2005 Farrell appeared on John Stossel's \"\"Give Me A Break\"\" segment of 20/20 to discuss, in his view, why men earn more. In the report he is seen speaking before the Cato Institute. He asked members of the audience to stand if they worked at least two years at a job meeting certain criteria: jobs which exposed them to wind and rain or long hours, for example. It was almost entirely men who stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some suggest that the Cato Institute event had been staged to promote Farrell's books and opinions. Nonetheless, the event served to illustrate one of Farrell's key points - that women tend to choose, and are generally encouraged by the popular press to choose, jobs that are socially fulfilling rather than monetarily fulfilling. For instance, men are encouraged to work well-paid, long-hours jobs, whereas women are encouraged to search for jobs that allow them more time with their children or are seen as socially pleasant, involving little physical labour or serious physical unpleasantness. These jobs, across the board, tend to be paid less than the former. In addition, men are more likely to do overtime (and are of course encouraged to do so) than women, so necessarily get paid for more hours worked.\n",

You asked for a rock, so I brought one, and not just any old rock either.  Hope you like it.   We went there one day.

Thanks for keeping an eye on some articles.  I see Sharon Tate is up for discussion.  I think another good example is Anne Frank.  If Anne had lived, her diary may never have even been published, and had it been published it may have failed to attract the audience that it is has.   Her notability is unquestionably linked not only to her death, but the reaction to it.   I don't attempt to put Sharon in the same category, but the principal is the same.  If she had lived, her acting career may have fizzled to nothing, but she didn't live, and that's the whole point.    To reduce either of them to a straightforward bio that ends with their deaths, would be failing to adequately assess either of them.\n",

      "Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.\n",

Passive tools create no tangible effectthese are measuring devices, ladders, flashlights, stools, clamps (unless they are used for crushing), jacks, beakers, tape recorders(?). Active tools have a tangible effect: drills, pencils, hammers, nail clippers, spatulas, shovels. In general tools act on a material (although not necessarily a specific material, like a flashlight will act on most things): pencils act on paper, egg beaters act on eggs, saws on wood or metal, caulk guns on caulk, paint brushes on paint, beakers on chemicals. So consider a container of correction fluid: the little brush on the inside of the lid is the active tool, the container is the passive tool and the whiteout is the material.

Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.\n",

Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.\n",

At least sources more critical of Francis have the merit of taking him seriously\"\" It is on Wikipedia's POV policies that you have to represent the magnitude of each side properly. For instance, you see little merit in not taking him seriously. I too think sarcasm is sometimes an easy scapegoat, but the page isn't about my opinion or yours, it's about him and about the entirety of opinions available on him (e.g. something like \"\"supporters claim he was often misinterpreted through his sarcastic persona, yet critics think said persona is used as an excuse for ignorant statements\"\" could be helpful).

I will possibly continue making the factual adjustments on your userpage but more infrequently. I don't understand why you won't revert to the legal description, you are letting personality clashes get in the way of facts, egos shouldn't compromise the truth. Am I correct in stating it would not be too much work for you to revert to my version or are their difficulties in upholding the link? Be a man and swallow your pride in the interest of truth please Stemonitis. Thank you for your time and patience.  \"\n",

      "LOL too idyllic by half.  The whole point of such changes in BC is confrontation and revanchism and an opportunity to overturn the colonial landscape and smooth ruffled cultural egos, and \"\"getting even with whitey\"\" is very much part of the motive, as with Chinaman's Peak becoming Ha Ling Peak (in Alberta) or various Chinaman Lakes becoming China Lake (they don't have problems with anything being called Chinatown, though, and seem intent on popularizing the term for anywhere with some condo residents from HK and a couple of Chinese-only stores).  The rationalizations for Salish Sea included \"\"elders\"\" talking about how it was \"\"the ancient name\"\" and \"\"the correct name\"\", even though it's not only Salishan peoples who lived around it, nor that that word is a misappropriation of an Interior Salishan's people to the whole language group.  So these \"\"fictive\"\" names (Haida Gwaii is of early '70s or late '60s coinage, ONLY) are often cultural justapositions to start with; in one case, Sto:lo, which should be the name of the river, it's come into use for a grouping of Halkomelem-speaking peoples formerly known as the Fraser River Indians - even the term Cowdigin/Cowichan, now confined to a certain area of Vancouver Island, applied to all the peoples up to Yale; my piont being that if they wanted to rename the Fraser River, they should have thought of that before making \"\"Fraser River\"\" their name in their own language.  It also doesn't help that the way our languages give names to some kinds of things, native languages don't label the landscape in the same way; they may name a particular flank or toe of a mountain, or for an eddy in the river that has some story attached to it; they may not have a name for the adjacent land(forms).  Anyway the point of the native-name movement is largely to drive \"\"white\"\" names off the landscape entirely...they just don't have enough replacement names to go around, and the political inertia is incredible....as noted the only reason Campbell cut the Haida name deal was so he could get them to sign onto an indepednent power proposal for his campaign donors....  \"\n",

The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when it's necessary — that is, when there's no other article by that name.  This is why, for example, Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down (Battlestar Galactica) — there is no other article that could be at that page.  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WP:D, specifically WP:D#Deciding to disambiguate, which says:\n",
      "Ask yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes \"\"Go\"\", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman's nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?) When there is no risk of confusion, do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page.\n",
      "The argument you give (that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify) has been considered in the debate at WT:TV-NC, but most editors felt that the \"\"consistency\"\" was a misleading virtue, since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme.  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it.  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic.\n",

      " Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \n",
      "\n",
      "A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \n",

It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say \"\"Fall Classic Portal\"\"?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the \"\"Background\"\" section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night.

I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research?

Other infectious agents include Campylobacter, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, enterotoxogenic E. coli, e. coli 0157:H7, Shigella, and various enteric viruses. More rarely, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Cyanobacterium may also cause disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vectors for infectious diarrhea, both within and outside wilderness, are limited to contaminated food, water, and hand-to-mouth transmission. It may be difficult to accurately associate a particular case with a recent wilderness visit, because incubation can vary widely,  up to several weeks or more, while infection outside the wilderness is common. \n",

The most common causes are viruses, followed by bacteria and parasites including Giardia[]. Other important causes of diarrhea in the U.S. are non-infectious, and include medications, stress, or a change in eating or exercise patterns. [] \n",

      "Non-infectious gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea, is common as a result of strenuous excercise [].

      "I don't know if you're aware that in January 06 there was extensive discussion of the issue of lists that try and combine a person's ethnic or religious affiliation with something completely unrelated to that.

We've seen the comments from User: GorillazFanAdam. While I can see some way in which a list of people who were victims because they were Jewish (gay, missionaries) could have merit (but I'm not sure it warrants inclusion on Wikipedia), I cannot see how a list of criminals could have the same merit. To act in a manner that is criminal is effectively a declaration that the faith into which you were born, or claim by conversion, is effectively a sham. So I am against the list of criminals and victims remaining not only because it not doing anything of value in the context of an encyclopedia but because it is potentially offensive.\n",

It was said that a List of Islamicist athletes has values because such athletes choose to recognise aspects of the Koran in the way that they compete (women wearing a burka [spelling?] for example). \n",

      "The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under \"\"homophobia\"\" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as \"\"homophobic organization.\"\" The categories \"\"homophobic organization\"\" and \"\"homophobe\"\" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. \"\"Homophobia\"\" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).  \"\n",

      "No problem.  It was a long discussion with a lot of changing opinions, but I think it's felt that eras on class categories imply that every ship in that category served in that era (not necessarily true), while eras on class articles don't imply that to the same extent, and it's kind of nice to see what classes served in an era instead of just seeing a list of ships.\n",
      "\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three things to point out about this discussion:\n",
      "1. The \"\"material\"\" concept of time. Time here is not intended as an abstract entity, a chronological coordinate, as we are used to.  A \"\"time\"\" is the complex of all existing beings, things, circumstances and processes occurring in a particular historical instant. So it 's like an enormous set including everything existing or going on at that moment. If you consider the next instant, another enormous set is determined and that 's different form the previous one, as many things or situations have been changed. So we are included in the times because we are among the countless things and beings \"\"contained\"\" in the flowing times.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Sorry Memoro, but I must notice that your feeling of a possible deponent behaviour of the verb \"\"muto\"\" is baseless and factually incorrect.\n",
      "Indeed, consulting several Latin grammars and dictionaries I found no trace, no hint of a use of \"\"muto\"\" as a deponent or semi-deponent verb, at least in the classics. Simply, when a verb is provided with both forms, active and passive, it cannot be a deponent.\n",
      "It is however true that \"\"mutare\"\", as well as \"\"to change\"\" in English, may have a transitive or intransitive meaning. When it is transitive there is someone who performs changing and someone who undergoes it; so we can use the active or passive form to determine who 's the agent. We can say  \"\"I change you\"\" or \"\"I am changed by you\"\", leaving no doubt on who 's the author and who the object of changing. In the second case (the passive one) it 's wholly evident that change is not due to my will.\n",
      "With the intransitive meaning instead, the concept of voluntariness of change remains more shaded and vague. When I say: \"\"I change\"\", I make quite clear that some changing is affecting myself, but nothing is said about whether this change is due to my will or to the events, circumstances or somebody else 's will. Thus, using the active form with intransitive meaning, we can leave an open door to both possibilities:  - a. I am changing because I actually want to, or - b. I am forced to change by circumstances or others.\n",
      "Therefore, whoever was the author of this maxim, he had a simple way to let us think that we might be the artificers of our own change. He only had to write the verb in its active form: \"\"mutamus\"\". A simple \"\"s\"\" instead of an \"\"r\"\". That wouldn 't even afffect the hexameter 's rhythm. But he (purposedly in my opinion) chose the passive form; so expressly underlining our \"\"passivity to the change\"\".\n",
      "Moreover, he used a special trick to give an even stronger emphasis to the passivity. Normally speaking in Latin, one would say \"\"et nos mutamur\"\"; but here we see \"\"nos et mutamur\"\". Exchanging the pronoun with the conjunction is a rare expedient to emphasize the latter (in Latin language, everything that comes \"\"after\"\" has higher importance in a sentence 's  context). This special exchange serves to point out that this \"\"nos et\"\" is not a simple \"\"et nos\"\"; we should translate it as \"\"and we too\"\"; but other stronger translations could be: \"\"and we forcedly\"\", \"\"and we ineluctably\"\", \"\"and we a fortiori\"\". \n",
      "All this drives me to the conclusion that the sentence 's author wanted to stress as much strongly as possible that we are \"\"passive\"\" poor things in front of the general changing going on through the entire universe. So the true extensive meaning of the phrase is:\n",
      "\"\"When everything existing in the universe is subject to change by circumstances and force majeure; how could we, poor little human things, pretend not being changed as well?\"\"\n",
      "This way of reasoning comes quite natural if you \"\"think in Latin\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. According to the ancient and medieval way of thinking, this sentence is nothing else than an Aristotelian categorical syllogism; i.e. the basic unit of logical reasoning.\n",
      "Here we have:\n",
      "- a major premise: \"\"Tempora mutantur\"\"\n",
      "- a minor premise: \"\"in illis\"\" saying that we humans are included in times \n",
      "- a conclusion: \"\"nos et mutamur\"\".\n",
      "That simply means we are forced to change because we are part of all things that are changed.\n",
      "In mathematical logic and set theory, these relations concern set inclusion. So here are: \n",
      "a set H containing all humans; a set T containing all times (as defined above) and an even bigger set C containg all things, beings, situations, processes, and complexes af all them, that are subject to changing.\n",
      "The minor premise states that H is included in T, the major premise says T is included in C and the conclusion is H is included in C.\n",
      "In other words this is what 's usually defined as \"\"the transitive property of inclusion\"\". Thus, a synthetic translation of our sentence in sheer mathematical terms is:   H ⊂ T, T ⊂ C   ⇒  H ⊂ C\"\n",

Anyway, I certainly did not mean to trivialize the suffering of vicitms of racism, only to say that most scientists  racist and anti-racist  have not been persecuted the way Galileo was.  Perhaps racist scientists should be.  But even here I would qualify it  not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele, I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context  we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind.  In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things.  But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

He has also worked for the Nine Network and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a freelance commentator/reporter/presenter, mainly covering motorsport (auto racing).

      "After cutting his teeth with SBS motorsport program Speedweek, Rust was drafted into Channel 9's commentary team for the final Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix at the Eastern Creek Raceway in 1996. He called the support races with 1980 F1 World Champ Alan Jones. In 1997 he was hired by Ten to host the Australian Super Touring Championship for 2-litre Touring Cars - a position previously held by his close friend Leigh Diffey who had moved on to Network Ten's V8 Supercar coverage.  Rust commentated the Aust. Super Touring Championship for 2 years before starting work as V8 pit reporter late in '98. He was a part of Ten's V8 coverage for almost 10 years - even hosting and anchoring the commentary on occasions.  During this period the station won numerous Logie Awards for its broadcast of the famous Bathurst 1000 and Rusty developed a reputation as a pit specialist also working on the Gold Coast Champ Car race and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne. Despite an offer to join the Seven Network in 2007, Rust stayed with Ten to front the station's MotoGP and F1 broadcasts and its long running magazine motorsport show RPM.

      "The meaning of jihad\n",
      "The semantic meaning of the Arabic term jihād has no relation to holy war or even war in general. It derives, rather from the root j.h.d., the meaning of which is to strive, exert oneself, or take extraordinary pains. Jihād is a verbal noun of the third Arabic form of the root jahada, which is defined classically as \"\"exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation.\"\" 14 Such an object is often categorized in the literature as deriving from one of three sources: a visible enemy, the devil, and aspects of one's own self. There are, therefore, many kinds of jihād, and most have nothing to do with warfare. \"\"Jihād of the heart,\"\" for example, denotes struggle against one's own sinful inclinations, while \"\"jihād of the tongue\"\" requires speaking on behalf of the good and forbidding evil. 15 ...\n",
      "\n",
      "(removed large quote from a narration about the varying kinds of jihad)\n",
      "\n",
      "... Muhammad is also credited with saying: \"\"The best jihād is [speaking] a word of justice to a tyrannical ruler.\"\" 17 The qualifying phrase \"\"in the path of God\"\" (fi sabīl Allah) specifically distinguishes the activity of jihād as furthering or promoting God's kingdom on earth. It can be done, for example, by simply striving to behave ethically and by speaking without causing harm to others or by actively defending Islam and propagating the faith. Jihād as religiously grounded warfare, sometimes referred to as \"\"jihād of the sword\"\" (jihād al-sayf), is subsumed under the last two categories of defending Islam and propagating the faith, though these need not be accomplished only through war. When the term is used without qualifiers such as \"\"of the heart\"\" or \"\"of the tongue,\"\" however, it is universally understood as war on behalf of Islam (equivalent to \"\"jihād of the sword\"\"), and the merits of engaging in such jihād are described plentifully in the most-respected religious works. 18 Nevertheless, Muslim thinkers, and particularly ascetics and mystics, often differentiate between the \"\"greater jihād\"\" (al-jihād al-akbar) and the \"\"lesser jihād\"\" (al-jihād al-asghar), with the former representing the struggle against the self and only the \"\"lesser jihād\"\" referring to warring in the path of God. 19 \n",

The July entry had to have been written in November since the event (the deaths/funeral music) was listed along with it.

It is often easier to explain the reason for a block at the time than it is to explain a block well after the fact.\n",

A policy proposal, if you seriously want it made effective, needs several things.  It should be linked to Wikipedia:Policy thinktank (that may be a category thing now...haven't proposed anything in ages).  It should be announced that it is available for discussion in as many public ways as you can think of (I'd say the village pump and the mailing list are best...probably WP:AN too).  Set a time (say, 1 month?) that is left for discussion only (that is, voting will not start until at least ).  Once discussion has reached some kind of consensus, establish a clear voting schedule (what possible votes may be cast  yes, no, neutral, for example  what each type of vote means in real terms, how long voting will last, who is eligible to vote, whether or not the question may be altered once votign is underway, etc.).  Alternatively, if discussion seems generally to favor the idea (but it's not clear that there's enough consensus to make it enforceable policy), it may simply linger as Wikipedia:Semi-policy, in other words, a principle that's a very good idea that a lot of people like, but which for one reason or another isn't fully policy.

If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the \"\"christians\"\". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the \"\"severe methodological flaws\"\" and \"\"factual errors\"\" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of \"\"pseudo-science\"\" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified.

Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of \"\"numerous books and articles\"\" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?\n",

Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category \"\"Pseudowissenschaft\"\" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they \"\"discovered\"\" \"\"Van Hooff\"\", taking him as \"\"proof\"\", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is \"\"only\"\" a quotation! ;-)\n",

      "1. Wikipedia Elective surgery states: \"\"Elective surgery is surgery that is scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Semi-elective surgery is a surgery that must be done to preserve the patient's life, but does not need to be performed immediately.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective surgery as follows: \"\"Surgery that is subject to choice (election)...As opposed to urgent or emergency surgery.\"\" []\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective as follows: \"\"In medicine, something chosen (elected). An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent. Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor. The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time.\"\" []\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Wikipedia Surgery states: \"\"Types of surgery: Surgical procedures are the commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation. Based on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. Based on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus a reasonable person would conclude that non-emergency therapeutic surgery is a subcategory of elective surgery. Nearly all surgical abortions are NOT emergency procedures (in other words, they are scheduled procedures and are not medical emergencies).      \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that this Abortion article's inartful use of the terms \"\"elective\"\" and \"\"therapeutic\"\" confuses the reader rather than clarifying important distinctions. One would use \"\"elective\"\" to describe a procedure based on the timing of the surgery. One would use the term \"\"therapeutic\"\" to describe a procedure based on whether there has been a diagnosis.  The 2 terms are not mutually exclusive.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If the terms \"\"elective\"\" and \"\"therapeutic\"\" are to be applied consistently (with no politically correct definitions for procedures performed on pregnant women), then virtually all therapeutic abortions are also elective procedures. Practically speaking, in nearly all modern situataions the 2 terms will be mutually inclusive because modern medicine considers the satisfaction of any woman's desire to no longer be pregnant (regardless of the reason why she no longer wants to be pregnant) as \"\"therapeutic\"\", and abortion is virtually NEVER performed under emergency conditions (in other words: there are virtually no occurences in which an abortion must be done immediately to avoid a serious health risk).   \n",
      "\n",
      "The current section of this article called \"\"Induced\"\" [] contains a false dichotomy when it states: \"\"Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to: ... An abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman \"\"for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease.\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "This false dichotomy should be corrected by helping the reader understand that the 2 terms therapeutic and elective are virtually synonymous, rather than leading the reader to incorrectly think that an abortion is EITHER elective OR therapeutic. Rarely will any therapeutic abortion not also be elective.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, using the term \"\"therapeutic\"\" also implies that the condition of being pregnant is a disease or a health defect, when in reality, absent any political use of medical terminology, pregnancy is a sign of a healthy reproductive system and is never a disease. There are extremely rare occassions when organs of or near the reproductive tract are diseased and an abortion could thus be therepeutic to the gravid woman (though fatal to the fetus). \n",

      "Most of us are sympathetic to your personal story, and we understand the importance to you of your relationship with Endal. However, as you have noticed, we have guidelines for what can be included on Wiki. I have been working to make the Endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible. Dogs that have long pedigrees are not (at the moment, but things may change!) considered to be notable on Wiki. Wiki, however, is quite fluid, and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry. The reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the Endal article on Wiki is not your relationship with the dog, nor its pedigree (it wouldn't matter if Endal was a mongrol), but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage. That the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm, and some questioning of the article - especially as you started the article on Wiki yourself. It just looks like a vanity thing - and we do get a lot of that on Wiki - some people don't quite get that this is an encyclopedia rather than a free home page for whatever they fancy putting on it! However, regardless of who started the article, I feel that the amount of coverage that has been generated by yourself for your dog gives it a certain amount of notability. As you are so close to the subject, there is the question of original research and other Wiki principles that may be broken. I would strongly suggest that you refrain from editing the article until you are more familiar with Wiki procedure - you may just push it into a decision for deletion either now or some point in the future (yes, Endal can be submitted for future considerations for deletion - passing the current discussion does not make it secure!).

For instance, if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus before the 2007 season begins, only 2006 is listed.  But if a guy plays for Colorado in the 2006 season and is traded to Columbus during the 2007 season (June, say), both 2006 and 2007 are listed as years for his Colorado tenure even if he didn't play a match for Colorado during 2007.

      "\" is known as the al'Buraq wall to Muslims. I do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many Muslims, particularly some Palestinian and Jordanian Muslims. However, from everything that I've read, the name is of rather recent provenance, and was never known as such among Muslims until the foundation of modern Israel. If memory serves, it didn't really have any circulation until the last two decades or so.  from the obscure claims of Mujir al'Din that the Buraq was left there when Mohammad ascended to paradise, which itself is a legend derived from Sahih al'Bukhari, the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor; that's of little relevance here, though. I see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing, and I don't advocate any necessity of removing it. However, the attribution itself is sixteenth century, and actual naming of it as the \"\"al'Buraq wall\"\" is incredibly recent. I think we should at the very least clarify this, add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name, and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this. I just skimmed it, but I'm not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title (nevermind, it does). For all I know, it may itself be the origin of the name, with this article helping to disseminate it. Since this, like every Jerusalem-related article, is contentious, I thought it best to get some discussion before I did anything.   \n",

      "It is referred to as the Jordanian Occupation, because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised, hence occupation. And while Israel's presence is also not recognised, (the last UN resolution on the matter calls for Jerusalem to be internationalised), in reality, Israel excercises its sovreignty over the site. As this matter is disputed, I did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site, but I could not find any good sources.   \n",
      "Jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it, i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation. The Israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if I'm not incorrect then the Western wall and old city were part of the West bank.

      "\":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real \"\"edit conflict\"\" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - \"\"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references.\"\" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of \"\"Welsh nationality\"\" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his \"\"explanation\"\" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about\n",

The Rambam states: \"\"These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.\"\" \n",
      "Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as \"\"a prophet from the midst of thee.\"\" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. \n",

What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: \"\"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.\"\" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.\"\" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. \n",

Major storms passing within 50 miles off our coast ('38, '44, Donna, Belle, Gloria) causing a \"\"direct hit\"\" are far more common, and can be just as damaging and deadly. I would say that a repeat of '44 today, would cause Katrina-like damage in the Northeast. New Jersey might be small, but it is also the most densely populated state in the nation. Many of the homes, especially those along the shore, are only a few feet apart.  A good storm surge like seen in '44 would devastate 100 miles of prime real estate that is far more valuable per square mile then that along the Gulf Coast. Also, strong storms passing to our west (Gale of 1878, Tropical Storm David in 1979) can put N.J. in a storm's right front quadrant, the most vicious part of the cyclone\"\n",

      "Howdy.  You modified some changes I had made to the intro to ETH.  I had posted some commentary on the reasons behind the changes on the talk page; it would have been nice if you had commented there, especially since I left it open for commentary for over a month before I put the change in place ;-).  If you disliked the way it's written now, you should see what it said before I changed it.  And just removing the citation (which I spent quite some time finding) is not very helpful.  Anyway, other than my slightly bruised ego, your point about the citation not mentioning ETH is well taken.  Regardless of terminology they distinctly were *not* talking about ETH but about UFOs.  I will try to change it to reflect that.  What the citation supports is the notion that when scientists review the evidence at hand, they conclude that some UFO reports merit further study, but they don't really comment much on ETH.  E.g. the notion that there's even a minority support for ETH in mainstream science is wrong.  And leaving the comment \"\"a few scientists ...\"\" is zero info, since you can pretty much find a \"\"a few\"\" scientists supporting any notion.

This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa.

      " I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... \"\"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons.\"\" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.\n",
      " Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of \"\"keep off MY article\"\" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )\"\n",

      "re: (My talk) First off: please don't get mad at me for what I say below. I say it in good faith, and most likely a naive view.It seems to me that you're going about interwiki-linking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way. Wouldn't something along the same style as the inter-language wikipedia links (i.e. in the bar on the left of the page) be far better, and much more elegant? Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page, it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter. Additionally, there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links (i.e. you'd add one set of links on, say, Wikipedia, and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites).\n",

      "I can see two issues with this: 1. it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code, 2. it's not possible to use tracking categories. Hopefully the first one of these shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and if inter-wikimedia-ing becomes popular, I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal. ... or am I misunderstanding what you're doing? The above works nicely if you're just linking similar templates together, and even if you're making sure that they have similar functionality. However, if you're making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_, it's not so good. In this case, a system like that used at Help:Link would be better - having a single master copy (the best place I can see for this is on the meta), which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often. That copying could be done by a bot, say every 24 hours, with the template being flagged for human attention if it's been modified anywhere but on meta. Of course, extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified.  ''\n",

      "My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)\n",

      "\n",
      "My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp.

When you created a new version of Template:Cosmology at Template:Physical cosmology, and then set the old template to redirect to it, you hid the history of the template. Where possible, please put the replacement template at the same location as the old one, or move the old one to the new name, then put the new code in place. (If you're worried about making a mistake on the new template and messing up the articles it's used on, then use a sandbox.) If you do that, then not only do you keep the history of the page, but you make it easier for those of us that are watching the template to see the latest changes to it (i.e. those during and after the replacement). I've requested a history merge on Template:Physical cosmology to fix this (which means an admin will come along and merge the histories of the templates at some point).\n",

If you prefer, you can just put in the LKRT link and let someone else add the others.  If you want to add more, here's the rule I've been following:  look in each category of which the article is a member.  If that category has a main article (like Korea in Category:Korea), then that main article should be linked  either from the text, or from the See also section.  The same for parent categories, within reason.  Here's an example:  Munmu of Silla is a member of the categories Silla and Korean rulers.  Thus, the articles Silla and Rulers of Korea are linked in the article text.  Those two categories are part of Category:Korean history and Category:Korean people.  Thus, History of Korea is linked in the See also section, and so is List of Koreans (well, it is now).   Both of those are members of Category:Korea, hence the link to the LKRT.  \n",

      "Tim - I seem to spend an enormous amount of time formatting these templates, but I actually think they are really useful, so I'm glad to see someone else is interested. One of my largest frustrations is a failure to distinguish people requested images of people from places and requested photograps of places. As a photographer, if I visit a city, it's easy for me to look through the category, see which places are in need of photographing, and then go out and take the photos. That's not the case with celebrities, athletes or politicians from a city, which I'm unlikely to just run into. I've tried to create some Category:Wikipedia requested images of people from City X subcategories to clean up the base categories Category:Wikipedia requested images of City X but it's a lot of work. I made a Wikipedia:Bot_requests/Archive_61#Wikipedia_requested_photographs_in_X_.3E_Wikipedia_requested_photographs_of_people_of_X request for a bot to do this but it didn't seem to get much support. Any thoughts on this?\n",

Personally I think WP will be equally fine with or without fair-use images, so it's not that big a deal to me either way - I just want the rules to be clear. Since it's you that wants to make other editors change their views, the burden is going to be on you to come up with the convincing arguments. It doesn't actually work to talk about \"\"being pushed to the edge\"\" - maybe it's true, but we lose editors every day for all kinds of reasons; only a prolific contributor with lots of friends is going to get any attention that way. Expressing frustration is a sign of weakness, shows that you can be outlasted in a contest of wills, and in this chaotic organization, willpower is everything. Attacks on the \"\"ideology\"\" put you in the \"\"enemy of WP\"\" category (perhaps unfairly, but that's how it works), and nobody listens to their enemies, not even if the advice is good.

      "\"In mathematics, an ordinal number, or just ordinal, is a transitive set of ordinals, or hereditarily transitive set.  That is, every element of an ordinal is transitive and its elements in turn are transitive and so on down.  The Axiom of regularity stops this recursion after finitely many steps, namely at the empty set.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finite ordinals are 0 = {}, 1 = {0}, 2 = {0,1}, 3 = {0,1,2}, ….  This is a consequence of two remarkable facts, that every element of a finite transitive set is itself a finite transitive set (so we can drop \"\"ordinal\"\" as a condition for membership in a finite ordinal), and only one set of each finite cardinality can be transitive, whence the finite ordinals can be identified with their cardinalities as per the foregoing enumeration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is evident for the finite ordinals that the successor of an ordinal α is α∪{α}.  In fact this holds for all ordinals.  We write α∪{α} as α+1.\n",

      "The set of all finite ordinals is transitive and hence itself an ordinal.  It is the least infinite ordinal, and is denoted ω.  It is the canonical example of a countable set, and its cardinality is denoted .\n",

      "Like the finite ordinals, ω has a successor ω+1, namely {0,1,2,…,ω}.  That in turn has a successor {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1}, and we can continue in this way until we reach {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1,ω+2…} = ω+ω, denoted ω·2.  Continuing faster we eventually reach ω·2+ω = ω·3.  We could consider ω·3+1, but moving yet faster we arrive at ω·4, ω·5, and eventually ω·ω, denoted ω2.  Picking up yet more speed, we arrive at ω3, ω4, … and then ωω.  Getting into high gear we speed past ωω, ωωω, ωωωω, …, to arrive at ε0, the least ordinal α satisfying α = ωα.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout this entire sequence, every ordinal has been countable, that is, its cardinality has been .  However one cannot infer from this that every countable ordinal is ω.  To see this, consider listing all infinitely many even numbers first, and then continue by listing the odd numbers.  Then 1 is preceded only by even numbers, but there is no even number immediately before 1 because there is no largest even number.  So unlike the usual enumeration of the natural numbers, in which every number but 0 has a predecessor, this enumeration is structurally different, that is, it is not order isomorphic to ω.  Instead it is order isomorphic to ω+ω = ω·2, because the set of even numbers standardly ordered is order isomorphic to ω, and likewise the odd numbers.\n",

This linear order is in fact a well-order, that is, every nonempty set of ordinals has a least element.  Hence for every predicate that is not false of all ordinals, there exists a least ordinal satisfying that predicate.  Furthermore no two ordinals are order isomorphic, and every well-ordered set is order isomorphic to some ordinal, whence the ordinals can serve to encode the order types of all well-ordered sets however large.\n",

It is encyclopedic and  not factually incorrect if it states at the top of the page the the winners from 1952-1967 are the winners of the Best Foreign Award.

      "        Craig Holden's novel The Jazz Bird, is based on the 1927 murder trial of Cincinnati bootlegger George Remus. Here's a quick look at where fact and fiction converge and diverge: \n",
      "        George Remus, the killer \n",
      "        Fiction: A lawyer and pharmacist who comes to Cincinnati from Chicago in the 1920s with a scheme that makes him at least $20 million. He buys distilleries licensed to sell “medicinal” whiskey to drug companies and then sells the booze to dummy drug companies while shipping it to illegal customers. \n",
      "        Truth: A lawyer and pharmacist, he was a friend and co-counsel of famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow. Mr. Darrow testified as a character witness for him at his trial. He came to Cincinnati from Chicago and turned a $10,000 investment into an estimated $80 million fortune in less than three years. He sold “medicinal” whiskey to legitimate drug companies he set up, then stole the whiskey from the drug companies. \n",
      "        Charlie P. Taft, the prosecutor \n",
      "        Fiction: He is the son of former United States President William Howard Taft and plans a career in politics. He fades away after losing the case. \n",
      "        Truth: He was the youngest son of the former president. He became Hamilton County prosecutor just a few months before the trial. His political career suffered a setback after the trial — he wasn't nominated for a second term as prosecutor. He did stay in politics, helping found the Cincinnati Charter Committee and serving as a councilman and mayor until his retirement almost 50 years later. He ran an unsuccessful race as a Republican for Ohio governor in 1952, the year George Remus died. \n",
      "        Imogene Remus, the victim \n",
      "        Fiction: She is the wealthy 25-year-old daughter of a high society family in Cincinnati. She is the wife of a World War I veteran left in a coma by a shell fragment when she meets George Remus. She tries, unsuccessfully to get Remus accepted by Cincinnati society. \n",
      "        Truth: She was a 35-year-old secretary in Chicago when she divorced her first husband to marry George Remus, who divorced his first wife to marry her. She entertained lavishly in Cincinnati in hopes of being accepted into Cincinnati society. The Cincinnati upper crust was willing to buy Mr. Remus' whiskey, but never accepted him, or his wife, as social equals. She was 39 when she was killed. \n",
      "        The trial \n",
      "        Fiction: George Remus defends himself, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. He plays to the press and frequently disrupts the proceedings, which are likened to a Vaudeville show by the Enquirer. The jury acquits him in 20 minutes, recommends his release from the hospital in time for Christmas and drinks up at a party he throws for them. \n",

      "\n",
      "I recall Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley hitting Florida within a day of each other, and both of them passing off the Jersey Shore a few days later.  It was the remnants of Charley, not Bonnie, which brought the heaviest rain to the Jersey Shore on August 15th, 2004. Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter. I will try to find sources to back this up, but I have followed every New Jersey tropical storm & hurricane since 1976, and work in the Office of Emergency Management. Some of the worst conditions I've ever experienced were during the passage of Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, because the wind and rain lasted a long, long time: about two days, with frequent gusts near hurricane force, even over that threshold just south of here..  Floyd, Bertha, Gloria and Belle were  stronger, but they moved faster. My community, Seaside Heights was in the direct center of 70 mph Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, with a dead calm lasting about an hour, sandwiched between periods very, very wind conditions. Hanna in '08 was the biggest wimp of all these storms: a bit of rain and wind, but mostly hype.\n",

Astrology entails the belief that celestial events, alignments, angles, etc., correlate with earthly affairs in ways that are not obviously causal, e.g., it being dark because the Sun has set. Using the constellations to know when to gather eggs, for instance, is a far cry from a Western astrologer consulting an individual's nativity to see when s/he will get married.

      "Oddly enough, I am truly agnostic on this particular bit of software. It's always been my position that it should have a fair trial, but it seems that at every step things have been problematic.  First off, there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major UI changes (the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit, and the switchover to Vector).  Then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was *not* the version to be introduced here, so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki.  The trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself, and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time, or whether that change was positive or negative. The majority of early supporters in the original PC poll wanted it to be focused on BLPs, but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that PC should be applied to currently protected or semi-protected articles instead, and those were the articles targeted in the trial. The WMF press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly-registered users to edit long-time semi-protected articles of high profile topics (the George W. Bush article was specifically mentioned), without discussing this in advance with the community. (It lasted less than 2 days on pending changes, with mountains of vandalism during that period.) Then there was the promise by the lead developer that PC would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise. Four days later, when lead developer responsibility changed hands, the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review, on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching.  Even with all of this disarray, I still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool. It was agreed that we'd start off with 2000 articles in the trial, starting with just a few and ramping up so that we'd hit the 2K articles around 2 weeks into the trial, with the expectation that if things went well, we'd add more incrementally, perhaps up to 10K; however, only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial, and I don't think we ever got above 1500.  Further, at that point, we'd pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial, except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion; as best I can tell, their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks.  I was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial, and I confess I sneaked in a pile of BLPs that technically didn't meet the criteria (they had been semi-protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers). Indeed, one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very, very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured. I also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on. A few weeks ago, I led a panel on the topic of Pending changes at the New York City Wiki-conference. Thanks to DGG, Becksguy and Jamesofur, who were also on the panel.   That same day, keynote speaker Clay Shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is \"\"broken\"\", it is not able to rebound back to its prior state. In my own closing statement, I reflected on that comment, and wondered if pending changes might be the \"\"culture-breaker\"\" for Wikipedia and, if it was, whether or not that would be a good or bad thing. Certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here. I don't think  the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker, but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be. I am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good-faith Wikipedians from which the community may not recover.     \"\n",

In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing.

      "The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.\n",
      "While the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:\n",
      "Any war could and should be categorised as an \"\"atrocity\"\" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....\n",
      "Unverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.\n",
      "...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.\n",
      "While it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.\n",
      "Directly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

The entire concept of race is in dispute, and regardless of how people ordinarily discuss differences, an encyclopedia ought to try to avoid such uninformed hypotheses in its entries. It might be better to describe, for example, a people as having blue eyes and fair skin and lacking the epicanthic fold, as well as being largely Muslim, than to try to categorize them by \"\"race,\"\" and so I'd agree that dropping \"\"Caucasoid\"\" would be smart. After all, much of the European population has at least some Mongolian ancestry, as do Iranians, Turks, Central Asians, and so on - and Uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their \"\"Caucasoid traits.\"\" And if you go back far enough, I suppose the entire world population has African ancestry. You can see how this can become like an argument about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, and has no place in an encyclopedia that is trying to be authoritative and factual.  \n",
